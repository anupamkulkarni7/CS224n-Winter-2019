You know what I do is write for kids, and in fact, I probably am the author for kids, you read in the U.S.
And I always tell people that I don't want to look like a scientist.
I can <unk> like farmer, or a leather clothes, and nobody has chosen a farmer.
I'm here today to talk to you about circles and <unk>
And you know that an epiphany is generally something that you fell somewhere else.
You just have to flip the apple to see it as a <unk>
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of complicated circle that I'm going to talk about.
My circle began in the middle school in the middle school, in <unk> Ohio where I was the rare person in class.
When I went to bleed to her every week in the bathroom of the kids, until a teacher saved me life.
She saved my life by letting me go into the bathroom of the teachers.
He did it in secret.
For three years.
And I had to go from the city.
I had a thumb, and 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- I found a lover -- and in the 1920s, I felt the need to start working on organizations fighting AIDS.
About three or four years ago, half of the night I got a phone call from that <unk> Mrs. <unk> who said, "I need to see you.
And I'm sure of adults we never get to know us.
You could try to Ohio and please bring that man that I know you've found.
And I have to tell you that I have a pancreatic cancer, and I would like you to join you, please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
And we went to see, we got <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
We found a place, <unk> and <unk> and <unk> us from his family, because it was necessary, because it was necessary,
It is something we knew how to do.
And as the woman who wanted to <unk> as an adult came to <unk> it became a box of cinders and was put in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle had closed, it had become a circle -- and that epiphany that I talked about it became present in itself.
<unk> is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I save the her.
And you know that that part of life needs everything that the rest of life.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm very happy that I have talked about this.
It also needs -- it needs dignity, love and pleasure. And it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important to me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express that humans are not separated from nature and everything is interconnected.
I went for the first time to Antarctica almost 10 years ago, and I saw my first <unk>
I was <unk>
My heart can quickly, I was trying to understand what was in front of me.
The <unk> around me around the water almost 60 feet -- and I couldn't even think it was a <unk> about another <unk> about another <unk> year after year.
<unk> are born when they come out of the glaciers or you break down the ice walls.
Each iceberg has its own individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some people refuse to hold up and hold it up to the end, whereas others can't afford it, more and <unk> in a <unk> of passionate passion.
It's easy to think, when you see a <unk> that are isolated and themselves, as well as we see ourselves as humans.
But reality is the opposite.
As a <unk> melts I'm breathing its atmosphere.
As a iceberg melts, the iceberg releases freshwater rich in minerals that feeds a lot of life.
I come up to photograph these <unk> as if it was the portraits of my ancestors -- knowing that in these unique times there are in that way and won't exist in that way again.
It's not death when it's <unk> not an end, but a continuation of its way through the cycle of life.
And part of the ice of the <unk> I photograph is very <unk> it has a couple of thousands of years.
And another part of the ice has over 100,000 years.
The last pictures I'd like to show you are from a iceberg I photographed in <unk> Greenland.
It's unlikely to be really a <unk> iceberg in it.
Here you go.
You can see the left one <unk>
It's about five feet.
And I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and your <unk> line.
You can see here, it starts to <unk> the boat has moved to the other side and the man is standing there.
This is an average Greenland, <unk>
<unk> water from about 120 feet or 40 feet.
This video is in real time.
And so he said, the iceberg shows a different side of his personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same time, every <unk> a baby.
So, two couples every single one with a baby.
I don't want you to get too much in the details of conception, because if you stop thinking about understanding in yes, they're not going to pay attention.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage I want you to imagine that, in one case, the chromosome and of the sperm joins the X chromosome into the <unk>
And in the other case, the X chromosome of sperm joins the X X <unk>
Both <unk> and it starts life.
We'll talk about them later.
In my ground on my ground to be two roles.
In one of my <unk> work with the story of anatomy.
I am <unk> by training and what I study in this case is the way people <unk> the anatomy -- that means human bodies, and <unk> how they have considered body fluid, the idea of <unk> what have you thought about the body.
The other role that in my work is an activist, as a <unk> of patients or, as I say sometimes, <unk> <unk> of people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical norms defy social norms.
I've been working, for example, with twins <unk> two people within a same body.
I've worked with people with <unk> people much lower than average.
And I've worked with many cases of people with <unk> sex individuals whose physics physics doesn't fit in male male and conventional female <unk>
In general, we can <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>
I'm going to give you some examples in ways of having a sex that is not <unk> in male forms or female forms.
For example, there is the case of the individual <unk> <unk> which is the <unk> gene <unk> and it tells the <unk> that we all have in the <unk> life that becomes <unk>
And then, in life -- the testicles produce testosterone.
But because this individual lacks testosterone, the body doesn't react to itself.
It's <unk> syndrome.
So there's high levels of testosterone but <unk>
As a consequence, the body is developing, following a course of female <unk>
When the baby looks like a child.
This is a little girl. It's raised as a child.
And often, it's not until puberty, when it is growing up and developing breast enough, it doesn't have the menstrual period when someone realizes something is going on.
After doing tests you realize that instead of having <unk> and <unk> it actually has <unk> and the Y <unk>
The important thing to understand is that you can think it's a man, but it's really not.
Women, as men, we have in the body of something called <unk> <unk>
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> glands produce <unk> the hormone <unk>
Most of the women as I -- I think -- I think a woman <unk> he doesn't know his <unk> structure, I think being a typical woman -- most women are sensitive to the <unk>
We produce <unk> and we respond to the <unk>
As a result, someone like me has the most exposed brain to the <unk> that the woman who was born with testicles who have <unk> syndrome.
So sex is something complicated. It's not that the <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in some way they can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago I got a call from a 19 year-old boy born and raised as <unk> he had girlfriend, and she had sex with her, he had a life as a boy and I had just found out that he had <unk> and <unk>
He had an extreme form of a disease known as <unk> <unk> <unk>
He had 20th <unk> and the uterus -- <unk> glands were so active and essentially created a hormone hormone environment.
As a consequence, their genitals were <unk> their brain was exposed to the hormone component, typically male.
He was born with <unk> nobody <unk> anything.
And it was at age 19, when he started having medical problems caused by the internal <unk> when doctors discovered that in fact, it was a woman in the inside.
Well, another quick example of a case of <unk>
Some people with chromosomes develop what is known as <unk> that they have <unk> tissue wrapped in tissue <unk>
We don't know why it happens.
So there are many varieties of sex.
The reason that children with these kinds of bodies are <unk> twins, or <unk> <unk> surgery -- it's not to be able to have a better physical health than a better physical health.
In many cases, people are perfectly healthy.
The reason why it went to several surgeries is that they are a threat to our social categories.
The system is usually based on the idea that a particular anatomy brings to <unk> a particular identity.
We have the idea that being woman is to have <unk> identity -- it's being black and means to have African anatomy in terms of historical terms.
A very simplistic.
And when you present a body that shows something quite different, we have trouble with the <unk>
So we have very dramatic ideas in our culture about <unk>
Our nation is based on a concept of <unk> very romantic.
Imagine how amazing it is that you have children who are born as two people in a body.
The most peak last year is last year with the <unk> African <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> her sex in the <unk> <unk>
Many journalists called to wonder: "What do you test to determine whether to determine whether or <unk> is a man or <unk>
And I had to explain to the journalists that there is no such thing that we have to test.
In fact, we now know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn't plot a <unk> line between men and women or women and <unk> and women and <unk> are us who we draw that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more we change the science, the more we have to admit that these categories -- that we thought were a stable <unk> categories that were <unk> directly with <unk> categories are much more <unk> than they <unk>
And not just in terms of sex.
Also in terms of race, something that is much more complicated than the terminology of <unk>
So as we see, we get into a suburban terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of DNA with chimpanzees.
What about the fact of <unk> of them in just a few <unk>
And as we <unk> in science we get more and more in a uncomfortable zone where we have to recognize that <unk> categories that are probably too <unk>
And we're looking at this in all walks of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture in the United States today, are the struggles at the beginning and the end of life.
It's hard to set up a moment from which a body becomes human and has different rights to the <unk>
There are very <unk> discussions today -- not in public, but I know inside the <unk> about when someone is considered died.
And our ancestors never had to do this with this question of whether someone was dead.
As a lot of them put a pen in front of the nose and if he moved still not to <unk>
If I stopped moving the <unk>
But today we can, for example, extract vital organs from a body and put them into another body.
And as a result, we have to address the prisoner's dilemma really the death of somebody's death, and this puts us in a difficult situation, where we don't have any simple categories of the past.
And you might think that this explosion of categories might be happy to someone like me.
In politics I'm progressive, to <unk> people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit that I got nervous.
I think these categories are much more fragile than what we thought was <unk>
<unk> from the concept of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension first, I have to admit that I am a desperate fan of the commons.
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave and bold and so <unk> in what they did, that I find myself so much watching that <unk> <unk> <unk> and not by the music, which is totally <unk>
That's what happened in <unk> with the <unk> <unk>
The <unk> <unk> were, to me, the first activists of the anatomy and explain why.
What they were <unk> was a concept of <unk> and I was doing it with another one that was radical and beautiful and stayed for 200 years.
And as you all remember, what our Han <unk> was the idea of <unk> The monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The monarchs of the old world didn't know the DNA, but they had the idea of the right idea of birth.
They had the concept of blue.
They were from the idea that the political power was coming in, for the right of blood passed the father to the father and then the son, etc.
The geneticists <unk> rejected that idea and replacing it for a new concept, and that concept was that all men are created equal.
They took the field of play and decided that the anatomy that mattered was the common anatomy and not <unk> differences, that was a very radical thing.
And they were doing it because they were part of a <unk> system where they were <unk> two things.
It was <unk> democracy and at the same time it was <unk> science.
And it is very clear, if you look at the story of the fungus, <unk> that many were very interested in science and in the idea of a <unk> world.
They were <unk> from the <unk> explanations -- so we had the concept of power that was being passed through the idea of a <unk> of birth <unk>
They were moving into a <unk> concept.
And if you look at it, for example, the Declaration of 2007, they talk about nature and of the god of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And as a result, they were passing the idea of <unk> <unk>
And in doing so, they were <unk> the foundations of the future Rights movement.
They didn't think that way, but they did it for us, and it was great.
And what is next?
And the women.
Then he came the success of the Civil Rights movement with people from the <unk> <unk> saying, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the rows of the Civil Rights movement saying, "I'm a man."
And again, people in color that are going to ask the coincidence of <unk> about the difference and again, and again, <unk>
We see the same with the Slow <unk>
The problem is, of course, as we look at the <unk> we have to start asking ourselves, why we keep certain <unk>
But, attention, I want to keep a few thousand <unk> in our culture.
For example, I don't want to give you a fish, the same rights that a human.
I don't want to say that we should be able to say we should be able to <unk>
I don't want to say that the five-year-old kids were supposed to have sex or get married.
There are some <unk> <unk> that for me to make sense, and I think we should support it.
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why keep them and make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two <unk> <unk> at the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in <unk> exactly the same day.
Let's imagine that one of them, Mary, was born three months before time, June 1, 1980.
So Henry, in the contrary, was born in term: March one of March 1980.
For the only fact that he was born three months before Mary is attributed to all the rights three months before Henry America, the right to vote, the right to vote, the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all of that not because it has a different biological age, but it's born later.
We found other <unk> in relation to their rights.
Henry, to virtue of being considered man -- if I haven't told you whether it's <unk> by virtue of being considered a man now <unk> <unk> <unk> that Mary doesn't have to worry about.
Mary.
Henry can marry every state with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman in some states.
So still <unk> categories of <unk> categories that are <unk> and questionable.
And now the question is, what do we do now that science moved so much in the field of the anatomy that we get to the point that we have to admit that a democracy based on the anatomy could <unk>
I don't want to give up science -- but at the same time sometimes I feel like science will become <unk>
Where are we <unk>
It seems that what happens in our culture is a kind of <unk> attitude that we have to draw the line somewhere, so we're going to do."
But a lot of people get stuck in a strange position.
For example, Texas at a certain time has decided to get married with a man there is no chromosome and to marry a woman there is to have y <unk>
Now, in practice, they don't do tests for the people.
But this is also very strange given the story that I told you at the beginning of the <unk> syndrome.
If we look at one of the founders of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his speech "I would say, <unk> offers a solution.
It says that we should judge people <unk> not in the color of their skin, but in the content of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yes, the idea seems like <unk>
But in practice, how do you do it?
How do we judge people based on the content of their <unk>
I want to point out also that I'm not sure that we should be interested in this to provide rights to people, because I have to admit that I know from some <unk> <unk> who probably deserve more social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say that maybe some <unk> that I know can make more decisions and intelligent decisions about their sex relationships than the people of 40 I know.
So how do you put the theme of the content in <unk>
It turns out very hard.
And a part of me asked what would happen if the character of a person could be measured by an instrument, maybe with an MRI <unk>
We want to really get to that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I do know is that it seems to be very important that America is going to continue this current of thinking about the issue of democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy and I think we're going to do a good job in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context like the Iranian where a man who feels attracted to other men is susceptible to being killed unless it's willing to be willing to submit to a trust of sex, in which case it is allowed to live.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context like one of a surgeon that I talked about a couple years ago that I had made <unk> twins <unk> to then pick up and thereby <unk> their fame.
But when the phone was asked for the operation, it was a very <unk> operation, and he said that in that other country these kids would be very <unk> and so he had to do it.
And I said, "Well, it's considered the political asylum <unk> rather than <unk>
The United States offers huge possibilities for people to be who are not <unk> to change the very well of the state.
So I think we have to be on the head.
Well, to finish up, I mean I've been talking about <unk>
And I want to think about what democracy would be like or as it might have been, if we were given more involvement in <unk>
And I want to say something a little bit radical for a feminist, and is that I think there can be different ideas from different <unk> <unk> particularly if there are people thinking about groups.
Since years, since I've been interested in <unk> I've also been interested in investigating the sexual difference.
And one of the things that I've been interested in is the differences between men and women in terms of thinking and operate in the world.
And what we know from <unk> studies is that women, on average, -- on average, not all, but in <unk> they tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and to care about those who are <unk> within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
And years ago, when I was in graduate school, one of my advisers who knew that I was interested in feminism <unk> I thought I was a feminist, like <unk> he made me a <unk>
<unk> what about female <unk>
And I thought, "It's the stupidest question I've ever heard.
Feminism is about getting rid of the stereotypes of gender, so there's no female in <unk>
But the more I've thought about your question, the more I have something like there is women in the <unk>
I mean, there could be something, on average, something different between the brain and the male that makes us more <unk> to complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So if the fathers were very aware of finding the way to protect people by the state, it's possible that there would be more empowered to this concept, we might have enriched the concept of protection with the <unk>
And maybe that's what we need to do in the future when we give democracy beyond <unk> thinking less in the individual body, in terms of identity and thinking more about relationships.
So as we try to create a more perfect <unk> let's think about what we do for each other.
Thank you.
In 2007, I decided that we had to rethink how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinks where to go to live and work, have the possibility to choose between at least a handful of different cities that are competing to attract new residents.
Well, right now we are far away from that goal.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't have a single city willing to <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that it's worth much more than its construction cost.
So we could easily be able to address the world -- perhaps hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may sound absurd if you've never thought about new cities.
But just <unk> by buildings of apartments.
Imagine that half of those who wanted to live in a apartment were already owners, and that in the other half will still be there.
They could try to increase the ability by making <unk> in all existing buildings.
But you know that the problem that you want, is that those buildings and the areas that surround them have rules to avoid the <unk> and the distractions of the construction.
So it would be very difficult to do all those <unk>
But you could go to a totally new place, and build a whole building of entirely new, always and when the rules of that place would be <unk> building <unk>
So I proposed that governments are going to take new areas of reform large enough to contain cities and gave them a name, cities under <unk>
Later I found out that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of communicating Honduras.
Did you know that every year about 75,000 <unk> would come out of his country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009, <unk> went through a constitutional constitutional crisis.
In the next presidential elections -- <unk> <unk> became <unk> with a platform in which we <unk> reforms and at the same time reconciliation.
He asked <unk> who was his boss of <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk in TEDGlobal.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a lot of evidence with users, tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under <unk> to their most fundamental ideas.
The first point was the importance of the rules, as those rules that say that you cannot go and annoy all the current residents of apartments.
It takes a lot of attention to new technologies, but it takes so much of technologies like rules for <unk> and usually they are the rules that prevent us from going forward.
In the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala sent him to <unk> a link with the <unk>
I showed you to <unk>
They called me up.
They said, <unk> the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we met in Miami, a conference room in a hotel.
I tried to explain to you this point about how valuable cities are much more valuable than its cost.
And I used this image that shows the value of the land in a place like New York City, terrain which, in some cases, worth thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract discussion and at some time, when there was a pause, <unk> said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
And the talk was describing in very simple terms that a city under <unk> is a place where it starts with a <unk> terrain -- a <unk> which is <unk> and a choice for people to choose whether they want to go or not live under those norms.
So the president of <unk> he called me and told me that we had to make this project, this is important, this one could be the path for our country forward.
He asked me to go to <unk> and talk back about the four and five of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included an image like this, which was trying to explain that to make a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
This airport is just covering over 100 square miles.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city, you have to start with a place that is measuring at least 1,000 square miles.
That's over 100,000 acres.
All the world <unk> <unk>
The faces of the audience were very serious and <unk>
The leader of Congress came up to the platform, and he said, "Professor <unk> thank you for your talk, but maybe we could see the video of <unk> talk.
I have here in my <unk>
So I sat down and showed the <unk>
And this <unk> <unk> that a new city can offer new options for people.
There would be a choice of a city that you could go to be in <unk> instead of hundreds of kilometers away to the North.
And also new choices for leaders.
Because the leaders of the government of <unk> would need help from developing countries, they could benefit from the countries that would help them establish and make the rules of the <unk> so that everybody could be confident that they were effectively <unk>
We went to the site.
This photo is there.
It could easily take a few thousand square miles.
And shortly after the 19th of January, they voted in Congress to <unk> their Constitution and add a constitutional arrangement that would allow these special development regions.
In a country that had just gone through this crisis <unk> voting in Congress in favor of this constitutional constitutional <unk>
All the <unk> all the <unk> in society, <unk>
To <unk> in the Constitution, you have to pass twice in Congress.
On February 17 of February passed over again.
Immediately after the voting on the 21st of February, a delegation of 30 <unk> was to the two places in the world that are most interested in participating in building in cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new center of the city which is building in Korea is bigger than the center of Boston.
Everything you see there was built in four years, after they spent four years getting the <unk>
The other interested country in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've built two cities in China and are preparing for a third.
And if you think about this practical sense, this is the point where we are.
They have a website, and they're already thinking about a site for the second city.
They're preparing a legal system that would allow the managers to be able to be able to operate under an external legal system.
A country has been committed to allow its Supreme Court to be the last year for this new <unk> system.
There are urban planners and builders, cities that are very interested in the project.
They can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know that they've solved is that they have a good number of inhabitants.
There are a lot of companies that wanted to be installed in the <unk> especially in a place with a free trade, and there are many people who would like to go to live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say they would like to change immediately somewhere else.
There's a million a year that comes out of Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who have to leave back to their family to go and get a job, sometimes they're unwed mothers who have to earn the money to just eat or buy clothes.
Unfortunately, sometimes there are children who are trying to meet with their parents who haven't seen, in some cases in a decade.
So what seems to think about building a new city in <unk>
Or build a dozen these, or a hundred of these around the world?
What seems to be thinking about insisting that families can choose between various cities that are competing to attract new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends were asked to say, "Thank you TED.
I'm <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what there is inside, I'm going to do a public confession -- and that is that I live obsessed with <unk>
I love to find, dress, and more recently, photograph and post my blog suits and different and different for every year.
But I don't buy anything new.
All my clothes is a second hand of <unk> markets and <unk> stores.
Oh, thank you.
<unk> stores allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment and my <unk>
I go to know people who are <unk> usually my money is going to be a good <unk> And I look at it, and buy it in my own personal search for <unk>
I mean, what am I going to find today?
It will be from my size?
I'll like color to me.
It will cost less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are positive, then I feel I've won.
Going back to the theme of my <unk> I want to tell you what I'm going to do, for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what do you bring to somebody who has all that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I suit.
I've brought up seven pairs of clothes, and nothing else.
<unk> in exactly a week, it's all I've put in my <unk>
I thought it would be able to find everything else that I would like to wear here to Palm <unk>
And because they don't know me as the woman who walks for TED in clothes,  -- that means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now for this week.
It doesn't sound that interesting?
While I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that believe it or not, I've learned in this adventure of not using new clothing.
Let's start with Sunday.
I call this a brilliant tiger.
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look good.
You almost always can see a <unk> for less than 50 dollars.
All the whole, including <unk> took me <unk> and it's the most expensive thing I've ever used in the week.
<unk> color is energy.
It's almost impossible to be a bad mood, when you're wearing a brilliant red <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other happy people.
<unk> The integration is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time.
Just yourself.
If you get rid of the right people, you don't just give you too much <unk>
<unk> <unk> of the child in the inside.
Sometimes people say it seems to me that it seems to be <unk> or I remember their <unk>
I like to say, and say, <unk>
<unk> trust is the key.
If you think you look good at something, it's pretty safe you are.
And if you think you're not good at something, it's probably probably true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until the 30 years that I really understood its meaning.
And I'll explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person on your inner and there is no look that you can't see it.
So there's no excuse for anybody in this audience.
We must be able to achieve everything we want to do.
Thank you.
<unk> A universal truth, six words for you: <unk> <unk> are going to everything.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a personal style, and it's a great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tested over and over again, when people came up to me this week simply by what I was using, and we had fantastic conversations.
Obviously this is not going to go into my little <unk>
So before I went home, in Brooklyn, I'm going to give it all.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn about this week is that we have to leave certain things.
I don't need <unk> emotionally to these things, because at the end of the corner, there will always be another <unk> <unk> <unk> and brilliant <unk> if there's a little love in my heart and I came back.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can split into two parts.
The left side, which is the logic, and the right side, which is the intuitive part.
So if you take a scale to measure <unk> <unk> we could design a blueprint of our brain.
For example, this would be a completely logical one.
This would be somebody who is completely intuitive.
So where do you look at your brain at this scale?
Some of them were <unk> by one of these extreme people, but I think for most of the members of this audience, their brain is something that -- with a great <unk> in both <unk> at the same time.
It's not to be mutually <unk>
You can be logical and intuitive.
I consider myself one of those people, that just like most of the other quantum physicists are <unk> we need a lot of logic to address these complicated things.
But at the same time, we need pretty intuition to make experiments really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We put together play with them and then we see as <unk> and then we developed our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
As an intuition that you can have developed over the years is that it says that one thing can be just somewhere at once.
I mean, it may sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this <unk> the <unk>
I remember looking at a child playing in a parking bar.
It was a small child, and he didn't do it very well, it always gets <unk>
But I bet that playing with that bar in the parking spaces, taught him a valuable lesson, and it is that the big things allow them to let them stay in a place.
This is a big conceptual model that you can have in the world, except you be a particle physicist.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist, because they don't play with parking spaces, play with these strange particles.
And when they play with their particles, they discover that they do all sorts of things really weird -- like they can go through walls, or you can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they called the theory of quantum mechanics.
And at that point in that point in the point in the stage, some years ago, you needed the quantum mechanics to describe those little particles.
But you didn't need to describe the big objects that surround us every day.
That didn't fit very well to my intuition, and maybe it's because not very often with particles.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but not a lot.
And I've never seen it.
I mean, nobody ever saw a <unk>
But I didn't fit it well as well as my logic.
Because if everything is made of small particles and all the little particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, so it shouldn't all follow the principles of quantum <unk>
I don't find the reason why it shouldn't be.
And so I would feel much better if I could somehow demonstrate that a common object also follows the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why a few years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object that you can see that has been in an overlap of quantum mechanics.
So what we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green point right in the middle.
That's the piece of metal that I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And here I'm going to zoom in a little bit. It's right in the center.
And then here we do a good approach to the little metal <unk>
So what we see is a little bit of a metal little bit of metal, with a springboard shape, and that stands up on a platform.
And then I did this almost the same way that a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a new chip chip with a new silicon chip for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this hole <unk> <unk> which is under the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum overlap but for it it needs a little bit of help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how uncomfortable it is on an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I am on an elevator alone, I do all sorts of weird, but then when other people come up with doing those things, because I don't want to get them out, or actually <unk>
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
The <unk> of inanimate objects are not just people, it's also the light that <unk> it, and the wind that goes on the side and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this little piece of metal to behave according to quantum mechanics, we would have to <unk> all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
<unk> the lights, then we put a <unk> and pulled out all the air, and then we put it up at a temperature of less than absolute zero.
Now, when you're just in the <unk> the small piece of metal is free to act like it.
So we measured their movements.
We discovered it was moving in very strange ways.
Instead of staying perfectly still, and it was vibrating. and the way it was <unk> was like a breath in this way -- like a <unk> which expands and <unk>
And by giving it a soft, we were able to make it <unk> and that we don't want to go at the same time -- something that only happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is something really fantastic.
What does it mean that a <unk> thing is not <unk>
Let's think of atoms.
In one case, all billion.
It's just in certain <unk> when those are <unk>
In the rest of the time they're <unk>
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, which at the same time means that all the piece of metal is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Seriously.
<unk> <unk> in a clean room to do this for all these years, because look at this, the difference on scale between one single atom and that piece of metal is roughly the same as the difference between that little metal piece and you.
So if one atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that piece of metal can be in two different places, why not you too?
I mean, it's my logical part of it.
So imagine if you were in several places at the same time, how do you be that?
How do you act your consciousness if your body was <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it's when we put it up, and we turned the lights up and look inside the box, we saw that the metal followed there in one piece.
And I was able to get to this new intuition, seemingly all the objects in the elevator actually only are quantum objects that are just <unk> in a small space.
You hear a lot about that quantum mechanics claims everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not so true.
It's more than that, it's deeper.
It's that those connections, your connections to all the things around you, literally define who you are, and that's the deep strangeness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And 18 months ago I was doing another work at Google, until I launched the idea of doing something related to museums and art to my chief who is here and that allowed me to do it.
It took me 18 months to me.
A lot of negotiations and stories, they were <unk> with 17 very interesting museums in nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on the <unk>
There's a lot of stories of why we did.
I think my own story explains simply on this slide and this is the access.
I grew up in India.
<unk> of a great education -- I don't have a <unk> but I didn't have access to many of these museums and artwork.
So when I started traveling and go to museums, I began to learn a lot.
And working on Google, I try to make the desire to make it more accessible to technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started doing it.
So better than it shows the demo, and then you explain to you a couple of interesting things that we've taken from their launch.
So, let's go to <unk>
Look around all the museums there are.
There's the <unk> gallery -- the MoMA, the <unk> the <unk> <unk>
I'm actually going to go into one of my favorite ones, the <unk> the art museum in New York City.
There are two ways to do it -- very simple.
We click and <unk> we are already inside the museum.
It doesn't matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that doesn't really matter.
You move around, and you get <unk>
They want to navigate the <unk>
We opened up the top, and with one single click, we jump in.
They're inside, you want to go to the end of the hall,
continue to go forward. It gets <unk>
<unk>
Thank you, but I haven't come to the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, <unk> by Pieter <unk> in the <unk>
I see the <unk>
If the museum shows you the picture, we click there.
Look, this is one of the images.
Here's all the information <unk>
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click on right now.
And this is one of the images that we've captured in what we call <unk> technology.
So this picture, for example, <unk> I think, about 10,000 million pixel languages.
And there are many people who ask me, "What do you get with 10,000 million <unk>
So I'm going to show you what you really get with 10,000 million pixel languages.
It can zoom in in a very simple way.
You see things that are going on.
I love this guy, his expression has no price.
But if you really want to get it to you.
So I started to play, and I found something that was happening there.
And I said, "Hang on, this looks <unk>
I went in and found that the kids were actually playing something.
I was a little bit, I talked to some people from the <unk> and I actually discovered that this is a game called <unk> which is to hit a <unk> with a stick <unk>
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get even deeper and deeper and you'll see that you can actually reach the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to pull out the picture, so you'll see really what there is.
Here's where we were, and this is the painting.
The best thing is coming, a second.
So now we're going to go back again at MoMA in New York.
Here's another one of my favorites, <unk>
The example I showed was to find details.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see how van Gogh actually created this <unk> work.
It gets it up and really <unk>
I'm going to one of my favorite parts in this painting, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is <unk> <unk> I think I'd never seen it before.
I'm going to show you another one of my favorite functions.
There are lots of things over here, but I don't have a time of <unk>
This is the really cool part. It's called <unk>
All of you, absolutely no matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that gives you the same.
You can get online to create your own museum, create their own collection from all these images.
It's very simple, we walked in -- I've created this function that I call <unk> <unk> -- we just made one spot around.
It's about "The <unk> at the National Gallery in London.
You can write things up, send it to your friends and keep a conversation about what you feel at contemplating these <unk> <unk>
So in conclusion, I think for me, the main thing is that all amazing things don't come from Google.
No, in my view, they even did not come from museums.
Maybe I shouldn't say this.
Actually, they come from those artists.
And that's been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope in this digital medium and justice to his work and that is represented properly online.
And the great question that I'm doing today is, "You did this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good evening everybody.
I have something to show you.
So think it's a <unk> a pixel <unk>
In our lab we call it sensitive design.
I'm going to tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- I'm from Italian, all the kids in Italy grow up with this photo on the wall of his bedroom. But the reason I show you this is that it has happened something very interesting on racing racing racing in the last two decades.
Now, some time ago, if you wanted to win a year of Formula 1, I took a budget and put it into a good pilot and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot were good enough, you made the career.
This is what engineering is, in engineering, it was <unk> in real time.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
Now what's interesting is that the control systems in real time are starting to get into our lives.
Our cities, over the last few years, have been covered in networks and electronics.
They're turning computers to open.
And like <unk> they're starting to respond differently and can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is a big thing.
As a note I wanted to mention that cities are just two percent of the cortex of the planet, but they represent 50 percent of the world's population.
75 percent of the consumption of <unk> and to 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with the cities, it would be a big thing.
Beyond cities, all these <unk> and <unk> are entering our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibit of <unk> <unk> for the late year at MoMA, during the summer.
It's called <unk> <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, start <unk>
In a certain way, it is as though almost all the existing atoms were getting sensors and <unk>
And that's changing the interaction that as humans have with the outer environment.
It is almost like the old dream of Miguel <unk>
You know, as Michelangelo <unk> the <unk> he says that he took the hammer and he threw it up in Moses -- you can still see a little bit a little bit <unk> and he said, and he said, <unk> again.
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just about <unk> <unk> in the idea of getting the environment and push something.
Let's start with the detection of the detection.
The first project I wanted to share with you is really one of the first projects in our lab.
This was four and a half years in Italy.
It was a very lucky summer, 2006.
It was the year that Italy won the World Cup
Maybe some of the remember, played Italy and France, and at the end of the <unk> he gave the <unk>
And anyway, I won Italy.
Now let's look at what happened that day by looking at the underlying activity on the network.
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the <unk> River.
It's the morning, before the game.
The line of time is at the top.
At the early afternoon there are people here and doing <unk>
It starts the silence.
<unk> from France. <unk> in Italy.
<unk> people do a call and go to the bathroom.
Second time. End of time.
First time <unk> a second.
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
They make Italy, yeah!
That night everyone went to <unk> to the center.
There you see the great peak.
The next day everyone was at the center of the winning team and the prime minister then.
And then everybody <unk>
You see the image of the place called <unk> <unk> where, from the <unk> people go to <unk> it's a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the city of the city in a way that we wouldn't have done just a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> is not people, but things we use and we use.
Today, we know all about the provenance of our objects.
This is a map that shows all the chips that make up a Mac, how it <unk>
But we know very little about where things are.
So in this project, we developed some small tags to track the trash in its shift by the system.
We started with a few volunteers who helped us in Seattle a little more than a year ago to label what were made different kinds of things, as you can see, things that all <unk>
Then we put a little chip, a label on the trash and then we started <unk>
These are the <unk> results.
From <unk>
after a week.
With this information we realized that there's a lot of <unk> in the system.
We can do the same as much less energy.
These are data that before it didn't exist.
They're happening very complicated things, and there's a lot of <unk>
But the other thing that we think is that if we look at every day that the cup that we <unk> not yet is still somewhere on the planet.
That if the plastic bottle we <unk> it still is still there.
If we showed that to people, then we can promote some change of behavior.
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague at MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us much more about detection and many other cool things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part that we talked about at the beginning, which is push over the environment.
And the first project is something we did a couple years ago in <unk>
It all started with the mayor of the city, who came up and told us that Spain and southern Europe have a beautiful tradition of use of water use in public space, in architecture.
And the question was, how can technology, the new technology, you will join that?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT in a workshop was, imagine that you have a <unk> and <unk> valves who are open and <unk>
It creates a <unk> of water with <unk>
If the pixels fall down, you can write on them, show patterns, you can show patterns, images.
And when you zoom in, the curtain will open so that we can happen, as you see in the picture.
We presented this to the mayor <unk>
He liked it a lot.
And they took a commission to design the building to the <unk> entrance.
We call it the <unk> <unk>
The whole building is made of water.
There is no windows and no windows, but when you come up with you so you can happen.
The roof is also covered in water.
And if there's a little bit wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> they go down the roof.
Or you can close the building and all the architecture disappears like this.
Those days there will always be somebody, in the winter, when you go down the roof, someone who was there and said, <unk> the <unk>
No, it's not that they've been <unk> but when it's low almost all the architecture goes away.
Here it is working.
You see the people who are going on in the inside.
And here I'm myself trying to stop trying to test the sensors that open the water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night it was actually even more fun to me.
All the children of <unk> came to the building, because the way to interact had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that would open to let you happen, but a building that followed <unk> and holes, and you had to jump to not <unk>
<unk> noises) And for us that was very interesting because of the architects, engineers, designers, we always think about use people to give our designs.
But then the reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things that people use.
This is a picture of the building with the physical pixels with the pixels of water and projections about them.
And this is what led us to thinking about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could begin to fly.
Imagine you could have small helicopters in the air, and that each one had a small pixel -- that changes color as if it was a cloud that's moving in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, as we saw earlier, which moves with others in synchrony.
Could we form this cloud, a cloud,
A kind of flexible screen like this with a normal configuration in two dimensions.
Or normal -- but in three dimensions, where it changes is light, not the position of the pixel <unk>
You can play with a different guy.
Imagine the screen appears in different scales and sizes, in different types of resolution.
And then all that could be a cloud of pixels in 3D, where you can get closer and look at and see from very different perspectives.
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> like earlier.
When the light lights the light, it looks like this. The same thing we saw before.
Imagine each of them controlled by one person.
We can have each pixel with a input that comes from people, the movement of people, etc., etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We have been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the best ballet dancers of today, the star of the New York City and the <unk> <unk> to capture their 3D movements and use them as entry for the <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left you see the <unk> they see it in different <unk>
It's so much 3D <unk> in real time as a movement.
It can take the whole movement.
You can go all the way.
And once we have the pixels with them, we can play with them, with color and movement, with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as a possible entry for the <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project that we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called the <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could engage people to do something and change our <unk> environment as an oyster nursery like a <unk> nursery like <unk> <unk> but with a cloud.
Imagine that we could make everybody a little bit of a <unk>
And I think the remarkable thing that has happened in the last few years is that, in the last two decades, we went from the physical world to the digital world.
We've digitized everything, as knowledge, and it's accessible across the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign, we can go from the digital world of the power world, the power of the networks, to the physical world.
In our case, this may we want to use it to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow it can be to address the challenges of today: think about climate change or CO2 emissions, how to move from digital world to the physical world.
The idea is that we can make people involved in doing this together, <unk>
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels in the same way that the real cloud is a cloud of particles.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud are the pixel in our cloud as well.
It's a physical structure in London, but it covered the pixel <unk>
You can move inside, have different experiences.
You can see from below, to share the main moments of the Olympics and even more, and it can be used as a form of connection with the community.
So it's so much a physical cloud of the sky as something that you can go up, like a new top of London.
You can go into there.
As if it was a new digital <unk> at night, but the most important thing is to be a new experience for anybody who goes to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better from what they are?
Suppose I told you that with just a few changes in their genes, they could improve the <unk> for a more accurate and faster.
Or maybe you'd like to be in better way, will be stronger to have more resistance.
Would you like to be more attractive and secure of themselves?
How about living more with good health?
Or maybe those people who always wanted to be more creative.
What else is it the most <unk>
What do you want, if you could choose something?
<unk> of the Audience: <unk> <unk>
How many people do you play creativity?
Raise your hand.
<unk> probably had the number of creative people present.
That's very good.
How many of you pick up the memory?
A few more.
And the physical state.
A little less.
How about <unk>
Oh, most of us, that makes me feel very well as a doctor.
If you could have some of this the world would be very different.
It's just <unk>
Or maybe this is possible?
Evolution has been <unk> here at the TED Conference.
The great <unk> of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> who also <unk> in the Catholic Church -- <unk> wrote an essay called "Nothing in biology makes sense of <unk> light from <unk>
But if they effectively accept biological evolution -- consider this: it's just about the past, or the future?
Is it about the other or us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch, well in the end, is, of course, the most interest in us.
<unk> of a common ancestor with the modern chimpanzees, about six to eight million years.
There have been maybe 20 to 25 different species of <unk>
Some of them have gone and <unk>
We have been here about <unk> years.
It may seem that we are very far from other parts of this tree of life, but actually mostly the basic machinery of our cells is more or less the same.
You realize that we can harness and control the machinery of a common bacteria to produce the protein of human insulin that is used to treat <unk>
This is not like human insulin -- but it's the same protein, chemically <unk> that comes out of <unk>
And talking about bacteria -- you realize that we all carry on the gut as much as the cells that we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think -- when Antonio <unk> ask them about the <unk> you think about the <unk>
And the gut is a beautifully <unk> environment for those bacteria.
It's warm dark, brown.
And we're going to provide all the nutrients that can want no effort to want their part.
It's really like a quick pathway for bacteria with the occasional disruption of some rush <unk>
But so we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential for our life.
They help digest nutrients <unk> and protect us from certain diseases.
But what is the future?
We're in a kind of evolutionary balance as a species?
Or meant to become something different, something maybe better adapted to the <unk>
In this vast symphony of the universe, life on Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, as one single one and only <unk> and human life, a little bit of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> of this talk, so I hope you've got it.
When I just went to college, I had my first kind of biology.
I was fascinated by the elegance and the beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution and I realized something fundamental in most of the existence of life, in the <unk> organisms, each cell is simply splitting and all the genetic energy of that cell is transmitting to the two cells daughters.
But when the organisms appear -- things start to change.
It goes into the sexual reproduction.
And something very important, with the emergence of sexual reproduction that goes the genome, the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, one might say that the <unk> of the body comes into evolution at the same time for sexual reproduction.
I have to say that when I was a college student, I was thinking, <unk> <unk> death by <unk> seemed pretty reasonable at the time, but with every year that was happening, every year I was going by, I had more <unk>
I got to understand the feelings of George <unk> that still <unk> in Las Vegas well in her 90 years.
And one night someone hits your hotel door to a hotel.
He opens the door.
In front of him is a magnificent <unk>
And he looks at it, and he says, <unk> looking for a <unk> <unk>
It's good, says, George, "I choose <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, who was working on a different objective to the goal of <unk> not necessarily <unk> just different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted to get us healthy.
I wanted to recover health in the disease.
I wanted to live more and more healthy.
Evolution is going to happen to the next <unk> adapting and <unk> generation after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view, you and I are like <unk> <unk> designed to send the genetic burden to the next level, and then let us fall into the sea.
I think everybody is going to make the feeling that expressed Allen when he said, "I don't want to get the immortality through my work.
I want <unk> <unk>
Evolution doesn't necessarily benefit the longevity.
It doesn't necessarily serve the biggest or the strongest or the fastest and the faster and the smartest thing to the most.
Evolution favors the better things adapted to their environment.
That's the only test for survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean -- the bacteria <unk> who can survive the heat of the <unk> that we would have -- if there were fish there, fish failed to be <unk> yet they've managed to do that a <unk> environment.
So what does this mean when we look at what's happening in evolution and if we come back to thinking about the place of humans in evolution and, in particular, if we look at the moment, at the <unk> I would say there are many possibilities.
The first one is that we don't know.
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the underlying reasoning would be that through medicine, first of all, we've known to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been <unk> and <unk> from the population.
And secondly, as a species -- we have <unk> our environment to be adapted to us as well as we adapt to it.
And by the way, we would have <unk> and we were so excited that it is no longer possible to have the isolation, for us to happen.
A second possibility is that there is an evolution of the traditional kind of natural type, dictated by the forces of nature.
And the argument here is that the gears of evolution roll it slowly, but they're <unk>
And as soon as the species -- as a species -- distant planets are going to be the isolation and environmental changes that can produce natural evolution.
But there's a third possibility -- an attractive and intriguing and terrifying possibility.
I call it the new evolution, which is not simply <unk> but <unk> and elected by us as individuals in the decisions that we <unk>
Now, how could this happen?
How could we get to do this?
We will first consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, are making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing to have more males than women.
It's not necessarily a good thing for society but is what you pick at individual and family level.
Think of it as well as possible to be able to choose not only sex from their own but in your own body to make genetic adjustments to cure or prevent disease.
And if we could make genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate <unk>
You wouldn't want to make those changes in their <unk>
If we look at the future that kind of changes is going to be increasingly possible.
The Human Genome Project began in 1990 and he sued 13.
<unk> million dollars.
The next year of being done, in 2004, I could do the same work for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a whole sequence of the three billion base pairs in the human genome at a very close cost to 20,000 dollars.
Not much of the way to really make the human genome for <unk> and to be more and more and more of the reach of all.
And those changes.
The same technology that has produced human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not just going to protect us themselves, but they're going to induce other viruses.
<unk> or there is no experimental trial in the course of the flu vaccine against the flu vaccine.
Can you imagine something good that comes out of the <unk>
That's actually today and the future is going to be increasingly possible.
Imagine just another two little <unk>
They can change the cells of their bodies, but if they could change the cells from their <unk>
And if you could change the sperm and the <unk> or change the newborn egg and give your children a better chance of a healthier life, remove your diabetes, to reduce the <unk> reduce the risk of cancer?
Who don't want any more <unk>
And then that same dynamic technology that can produce the changes in order to prevent diseases to prevent diseases that are also going to allow us to adopt <unk> <unk> a better memory.
Why don't you have the ingenuity of a Ken <unk> especially if you were able to <unk> with the next generation of the machine <unk>
Why not have a <unk> muscle that allowed us to run faster and more <unk>
Why don't we live time?
This is going to be <unk>
And when we're in conditions to pass this to the next generation and we can adopt the attributes we wanted to have become the evolution of before the <unk>
We're going to take a process that would normally take 100,000 years and we can go to 1,000 years and maybe come to 1,000 years and maybe happen within the next 100 years.
These are choices that their grandchildren, or the grandchildren of their grandchildren, are going to get to them.
We're going to use these choices to make a better society, more successful, more successful, more <unk>
Or, we're going to choose different attributes that we want for some of us but not for everybody else?
We're going to build a society that is more boring, more and more robust and more robust and more <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And the most profound thing of all: we're going to be able to develop wisdom and inherit the wisdom necessary to make these <unk> decisions.
For good or for worse, and before what you could do, these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a big explosion when you're at 900 feet tall.
Imagine a plane filled with smoke.
Imagine an engine <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, I had a <unk> seat that day.
It was the only thing I could talk about <unk>
So I immediately looked at it, and they said, "There's no problem. You probably hit some <unk>
And the pilot had gone off the plane, and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot took the plane with the Hudson River.
And usually that's not the way.
<unk> the motors.
Imagine being on an airplane and <unk>
And then three words said ...
The three <unk> words have heard.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to talk more about the flight project.
I was able to see it in his eyes.
It was terror. Life was <unk>
I want to share with you three things that I learned about myself that day.
I learned that it all changes in a second.
We have this list of things to do before they die, these things that we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people that I wanted to get in, and I didn't, all the fences that I wanted to do and have never <unk>
As I thought about that later on, I came up with a sentence, which is, <unk> wine <unk>
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'll open.
I don't want to hear anything in life.
And that urgency, that purpose, it really has changed my life.
And the second thing that I learned that day -- and this is as <unk> the George Washington Bridge was not for a lot -- I thought about, wow, I really feel a big <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity and my mistakes, I've tried to improve everything I did.
But in my humanity also gives rise to my ego.
And I'm sorry that I think about things that I don't care with people who do matter.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with people.
And then, as a <unk> on that, I decided to eliminate the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's much better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels like <unk>
I'm not trying to have the reason that I'm not trying to be <unk>
The third thing that I learned -- and this is like your mental clock is <unk> 14, <unk>
You see the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please go <unk>
I don't want this to be <unk> in 20 pieces as you see in those <unk>
And while I had a sense of, wow, I had the sense of, wow, it's not fear.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for all of our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want <unk> I love my life.
And that sadness was <unk> in a single thought, which is, I just wish one thing.
I wish I could see my kids grow.
A month later, I was in a performance of my daughter -- first grade, not a lot of artistic talent -- <unk>  And I scream, <unk> as a little bit.
And for me, that was all of the reason to be the world.
At that point I understood those two points, which is the only thing that matters in my life is being a great father.
For everything, the only goal I have in life is to be a good father.
I was offered a miracle a miracle of not die that day.
And I gave me another gift, which was the possibility of looking at the future and come back and live differently.
You guys are flying up today, the challenge that you have to imagine that the same thing happens on your plane -- and please not be so -- but imagine, and how to <unk>
What is it that they are still expecting to do because they think they're going to live <unk>
How would your relationships change and the negative energy in them?
And most importantly, they're the best parents who are <unk>
Thank you.
I've clearly been <unk> in life with many projects.
But the coolest thing I worked on was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk> in the '80s.
One day came to his house after running and he said, "Dad, I feel a <unk> in the <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
Today, it has total paralysis of total.
You can only use your eyes.
Their work influenced me.
I have a design company and animation so that, obviously, is graffiti is <unk> that we admire and <unk> in the world of art.
So we decided that we were going to make them <unk> <unk> and their cause.
So I went and met with his brother and her father and said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are you going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "I just want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to communicate with it and that he can be able to communicate with me."
And I said, "A second is not that <unk> saw Stephen <unk> is not that all people with paralysis, can communicate through those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you be somebody important and have a good insurance you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do they communicate then?"
Did you see the movie "The <unk> and the <unk>
They communicate from that way, they stick into your finger.
I said, "That's <unk> How can it be?"
So I was presented with the only desire to deliver a check, and instead of that signed a check that I didn't have the lowest idea of how he was going to be <unk>
I met his brother and his father there at that very moment, "OK, this is the Tony Tony <unk> going to speak, we're going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to make his art again.
Because it's ridiculous that somebody who has so much in their inner can't <unk>
So I talked about a couple of months later.
I met these guys called <unk> Research -- which have a technology that allows them to project light on any surface and then, with a laser pointer you draw on that and record the negative space.
So they go around making art facilities like this.
All the things that <unk> they say, are part of a life cycle.
They first start with sex organs, then with the bad words, then with the attacks, and in the end, people start to do art.
But there was always a life cycle in their <unk>
And so the journey started.
And about two years later, about a year later, about a year later, and so much to move things from one side to another we had achieved a couple of things.
One is, we touch the gates of insurance companies and we get a machine so that we could make a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And seriously, it's <unk> I call it <unk> because when you talk to the guy you get an email from him, and you say, "Don't <unk> This guy's <unk>
The other thing that we did was to bring seven programmers from all over the world from all the corner of the <unk> to our home.
My wife, the kids and I, we moved to the garage in the back and these hackers and programmers and <unk> and <unk> they took control of the house.
Many of our friends thought we were doing something completely stupid and that when you were <unk> you would have removed the frames of the walls and in their place there would be <unk>
But over two weeks ago, we went to the <unk> <unk> my son was part of my dog, and we created this.
It's called <unk> <unk> and you can see the <unk>
It's a couple of cheap sun glasses that we bought in the <unk> <unk> Beach, some copper wire and <unk> <unk> and Radio <unk>
We take a <unk> camera, the <unk> we put it on a light of LED light, and now there's a device that is free -- which is free -- we published the code -- we published the software -- the software is low in free.
And we created a device that has no limitation at all.
There's no insurance company that says, "No."
There is no hospital that can say "No."
Any person with paralysis has access to draw and communicate using just your eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much for you. That was amazing.
So at the end of the two weeks we went back to the <unk> room.
I love this photo because this is the room of another person, and that's his room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the great <unk>
And after more than a year of planning, two weeks of programming all night, Tony returned back to drawing for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system of his life and it's looking through the support system.
We ran the bed so that I could see.
And we put a projector on a wall in the outside of the hospital.
And he went back to him for the first time in front of her family and friends, and you can imagine what was feeling in the parking lot.
The funny thing was that we had to disrupt the parking lot so we felt like we were <unk> graffiti also.
At the end of this he sent us an email and this was what said, "This was the first time I drew in seven years.
I felt like I had been underwater and someone finally came to <unk> and would take me out there so that I could <unk>
It's not <unk>
So in some ways, this is our <unk>
That's what keeps us in motion.
And we have a long way to go through this.
It's a cool device but it is the equivalent of a <unk>
Somebody with this artistic potential deserves much more.
That's why we're trying to figure out how to make it faster and robust.
Since then we've had all kinds of recognition.
We've gained many prizes.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us are doing money with this.
It all comes out of our own pockets.
The prizes were like, "Oh, this is great!"
Armstrong had been something about us and then, in December, Time magazine recognized us as one of the greatest invention of 2010, and it was really cool.
The best thing about this -- and this is what ends of closing the <unk> is that in April of this year at the center of the angels -- there is going to be an exhibition called <unk> in the <unk>
And <unk> in the <unk> is going to have the best <unk> of the urban art, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> all of them are going to be there.
<unk> is going to be on the show which is pretty amazing.
So basically this is my idea: if you look at something that is not possible as possible.
None of what there is in this room was possible -- the computer stage, the microphone, the <unk> nothing was possible at a time.
Make it <unk> anything in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I never did anything with <unk> recognition technology -- I just recognized something and I was excited with wonderful people to make it happen.
And these are the questions that I want us all to do every day when we find something that we feel that we have to do. If it's not now, <unk> And if I'm not me, who?
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years in situations usually very difficult and at the same time as much dangerous.
I went to the hard <unk>
I worked in a dangerous <unk> mine.
It's in terms of <unk> and dangerous.
And I spent 30 days to eat just a fun thing at first, something difficult in the middle, very dangerous to the end.
In fact, in great part of my career, I've been thinking about horrible situations with the only goal to treat.
So when I knew that I would come here to do a TEDTalk about the world of brands and the <unk> I wanted to do something a little different.
So some of you may have heard of them, or not, a couple of weeks ago, I got an argument in <unk>
I sent some messages on Facebook, some of Twitter, offered the rights of the name of my TEDTalk in 2011.
What had was this: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk that you have no idea what it comes to and according to content could <unk> in the face, especially if I put it in ridiculous for you or your company to do it.
But I said this, it's a very good chance.
Do you know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a degree in progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew somebody was going to buy the rights of the name.
If you had asked me a year ago, I would not have been able to do it for certain.
But in the new film I'm working on, we tested the marketing world marketing world.
And as I said before, I was in horrible situations in the last few years, but nothing could be allowed to do anything that was so difficult or as dangerous as entering the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a movie.
Morgan <unk> I want to make a film that I try to do with the <unk> of products, marketing and advertising, and that all the film will relate to products of marketing and advertising.
The movie is going to call "The <unk>
What happens in "The biggest film ever <unk> is that everything on top at the bottom, got images of brand, and the time of brand the time; from the <unk> that appears before the title of the title of it.
Now this brand, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These people were <unk> film <unk>
And so the film is explores all this idea. <unk> <unk> is <unk> Is it <unk> Is it <unk> You <unk>
I'm a <unk> <unk> <unk> I just <unk> it. It was more by <unk>
It was <unk> <unk> forever."
But we're not just going to have the sponsor of the X brand in the title, but we're going to make sure it will use all the categories that we could in the film.
Maybe you get a shoe and you become the most cool shoe you <unk>
The most great car that you've driven in the biggest <unk> ever <unk> the best drink that you have <unk> <unk> of "The biggest <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is in addition to showing the brands as part of life, making them <unk> the <unk> <unk> to make it <unk> MS: And we actually showed the whole process of how it works.
The objective of the film is transparency.
You're going to see the whole process in this film.
That's the whole idea, all the shot of beginning to end.
And I would love to help me help make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's the first time I hear that; it's the maximum respect for the audience.
<unk> However, I don't know how <unk> is going to be people to that.
<unk> You have a <unk> I don't know if you're <unk> it's very <unk> but you know how it goes to <unk> <unk> No <unk> David <unk> How much money does it take to do this?
MS: A million and a half million <unk> <unk> Very <unk> John <unk> I think it's going to be difficult for them, but it's certainly going to be worth convincing a couple of big brands to convince them.
<unk> Who knows, maybe for the moment that the movie comes out, we will look at it as a lot of <unk>
MS: What you think is going to be the answer?
Stuart <unk> Most of the answers will be "No."
MS: But it's going to be difficult for the film to be <unk>
JK:
MS: That means you're not very optimistic.
So I got a <unk> I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. <unk> Awesome. Awesome.
MK: We have to think about what brands.
MS: Yeah. <unk> That's the <unk> When you look at the people that you have to do with.
MK: We have some places where to go. <unk> <unk> <unk>
MS: I thought <unk> meant we have a conversation outside the microphone.
<unk> the camera means "We don't want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And so it was, one by one, all these companies suddenly disappeared.
No one wanted to have anything to do with this film.
I was surprised.
They didn't want to know anything with this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought the concept of advertising, was to introduce the product to as many people as possible, to make so many people just as possible.
Especially in the world today this intersection of new media and old media and the stage of separate media is not the idea that we have that new vehicle that is worthy of attention that is going to take the message to the <unk>
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you know, my idea had an error <unk> and that mistake was this.
It actually wasn't such a mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been fine.
But the problem was what is this picture.
See, when you look for images of <unk> in Google <unk>   This is one of the first images that were introduced.
I like your way to <unk> Sergey <unk> No.
This was the problem: <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> which is characterized by the visibility or access of information, especially in the practices of <unk> being the last line perhaps the biggest line.
You see, we heard a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians <unk> President <unk> even CEOs <unk>
But suddenly when it comes to the reality, something changes suddenly.
But why? Well, transparency gives up --  like that weird bear, which is still <unk>
It's <unk>   Like this weird rural.
And it's also very risky.
What else is it <unk>
<unk> a whole bowl of <unk> <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started talking to companies and tell them that we wanted to tell this story and said, "No, we want them to <unk> <unk> history.
We want you to take a story, but you want to say <unk> <unk> story."
See, when I was a kid, and my father was <unk> in a lie -- and there is him looking at me as I used to say, "Son, there are three sides in every story.
There's your story, it's my story, and it's the <unk> story.
As you can see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with only one company, a agency -- wanting to help me -- and that just because I knew John <unk> and Richard <unk> of many years -- I realized that I would have to go through my own, I would have to take my mind and go to companies myself with my team.
So what I started to suddenly find -- which I started to give me <unk> is that when you start talking to companies the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I have friends that make big films and giants and others who make small, independent movies, like mine.
And my friends who make big Hollywood films say that the reason that their movies are so successful is due to the brands associated that they have.
And then my friends that make independent films say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant movies of <unk>
And the movie is called "The biggest film ever <unk>
How are we going to see specifically <unk> in the movie?
Every time I go out, every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
At any time during an interview with someone I can say "You're cool for this <unk>
You're ready? You see a little bit nervous.
I want you to help you for you."
Maybe you should put a little bit of this before the <unk>
And then you offer one of these <unk> <unk>
Both <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> are going to have their opportunity.
We're going to have so much for man as for <unk> strong, <unk> <unk>
That's the general look at that.
Now I can answer your questions and give you a <unk> look.
Karen Frank: We are a small brand.
<unk> the smallest type of movies that we <unk> are rather a <unk> brand.
So we don't have the budget that has other brands.
So do things like this, you know, remind people is the reason why this interests us.
MS: What words would use to describe <unk>
<unk> is in white.
<unk> That's a big question.
Woman: top.
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something that you put in the <unk>
Man: We talk about something bold <unk>
I think <unk> is a great word that really puts this category in positive versus <unk> smell and <unk>
It keeps you cool.
How do we keep you fresh or better <unk> more <unk> more <unk>
Things like that <unk> the benefits.
MS: And that's a <unk> company.
What about me? What about me? What about me?
I need to talk to the man from the street, people like me, to the common <unk>
They have to talk about my brand.
MS: How do you define your <unk>
Man: <unk> my <unk>
I don't know.
I like good <unk>
Woman: reviving the '80s, the <unk> <unk> unless it is <unk>
MS: All right, what's the <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> Man: I guess the kind of gender, the style that I have would be like a <unk> <unk>
I like a lot of dark color, lots of gray colors and things like that.
Usually I'm wearing accessories like sunglasses, or like <unk> and I like the <unk>
Woman: If Dan was a brand might be a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Man 2: The brand that I am, I call it <unk> <unk>
Woman 2: It's partly partly <unk> in part <unk> <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the kind of pet guy.
<unk> toys for pets in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my small sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is FedEx because we <unk> the <unk>
Man 5:  <unk> <unk> failure.
Is that what?
<unk> I'm a <unk>
<unk> I'm <unk>
MS: Well, we can't all be an Tom <unk> but I often joined at the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed somebody who could go into my head, someone who could help me understand what they call <unk> <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that personality personality.
If they were able to do it for them, they surely could do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the photos, right?
MS: Yes. The first picture is a familiar picture.
A: Tell me a little bit about how it relates to your thoughts and feelings you can be.
MS: These people shape my way to see the world.
A: Tell me that world.
MS: That world? I think your world is the world in which we're going to learn how people around you, your friends, your family, the way you live your life, the work you do.
All of those things come from, and they start in a place and in my case, and I start in my family, in West Virginia.
A: what's the next thing you want to talk about <unk>
MS: The next one is "This was the best day of my life."
AT: How does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and your way to be?
MS: It's like who would like to be me.
I like the different things.
I like the weird stuff, I like the weird stuff.
A: Tell me the <unk> what is that for us?
What's the <unk> What phase of <unk> you find right now?
Why is it important to <unk> What is the <unk>
Tell me a little bit about that.
A little more of you, which is not who you are.
What other <unk> have you <unk>
Now I don't have to be afraid of, what kind of Russian mountain are you?
MS: <unk> <unk> Thank you.
A: Thank you for your <unk> <unk> <unk> Yes. <unk> Thank you very much.) All right.
MS: Yeah, I don't know what's going to come out of this.
There was a lot of madness to all of this.
<unk> <unk> The first thing that I saw was this idea that there are two different sides of it, but <unk> in your personality of <unk> the brand Morgan <unk> is a <unk> brand.
They were very excited together.
And I think there's almost a paradox in them.
And I think some companies are just going to lie in one of your strong points or the other instead of focusing on both.
A lot of companies tend to avoid the things that they're not <unk> avoid fear, those elements -- and you actually support them and make them become positive for you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands are this?
The first here is the classic Apple.
And you can also see here to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there are <unk> brands and <unk> those things that have gone and come in, but a <unk> brand is quite powerful.
MS: It's a <unk> What's your <unk>
If someone asks you to give you your perceptual identity, your personality sensation, what would be?
You're a <unk> molecule. You're somebody who makes blood <unk>
Or are you rather a <unk>
A little bit more <unk> <unk> <unk>
The attributes of <unk> are like being playful as being cool as <unk> contemporary and bold and bold as <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> -- magical or mystical like <unk>
Or are you more of attribute to <unk>
You're conscious, sophisticated as <unk>
You're <unk> traditional <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You're good, stable, familiar, <unk> <unk> sacred.
Over the course of this film we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said, <unk> didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mainly because you would have no control, you would have no control over the final product.
We allowed us to tell the story of the <unk> and we got to tell the story in this movie of how you can now use MRI centers to identify the desire centers in the brain as much commercial marketing as a film.
We went to St. Paulo where they have banned advertising in the open.
In the entire city for the last five years, there's no <unk> there's no <unk> there's nothing.
And we went to school districts where companies are getting in the way in schools with available issues in the U.S.
The amazing thing for me is that the projects that I've had the greatest answer or the ones that I've been more successful is those in the ones that I've interacted with things directly.
And that's what these brands.
They went to the <unk> they took off their agencies, and they said maybe these agencies have no good interest in mind.
I'm going to treat directly with an artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that is going to make people think of people, which is going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And how did it gone? They look success?
Well, since the movie was released in the <unk> <unk> let's take a look.
According to <unk> the movie was released in January, and since then -- and this is not <unk> we've had 900 million impressions in the media for this film.
This covers only a two-year period and a half.
That's just in <unk> no press, no TV.
The movie is not <unk>
It's not online. It's not in <unk>
It's not even presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has begun to win momentum.
And it's not bad because almost all the agencies that we talked about, they encouraged their clients not to be part.
I've always believed that if you take a risks, if you take risks in those risks there are opportunities.
I think when you get people out of that, it's pushing the failure.
I think when you train their employees in loss of risk it's preparing their entire company to reward them from rewards.
I feel that what has to happen to move forward is that we need to encourage people to <unk>
We need to encourage people that don't have to be afraid of the opportunities that they can afford.
Ultimately, we move forward, I think we have to bring it into fear.
We have to put that bear in a cage.
<unk> fear of <unk> the risk.
From a <unk> at the time, we have to embrace the risk.
And ultimately, we have to harbor transparency.
Now more than a little bit of honesty is going to go a long way.
And that said that, with honesty and transparency, all my talk -- the <unk> has been introduced by my good friends of <unk> who were <unk> who bought the rights of the name in <unk>
<unk> <unk> big data on great opportunities for companies around the world.
<unk> presents <unk> <unk>
Thank you very much people.
June Cohen: And so I took it on the name of transparency, which happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: It's a fantastic question.
In my pocket I have a check at the name of the TED matrix, the Foundation, and a check for <unk> to be applied to my TED <unk>
The idea behind the <unk> computing worm is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their biggest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the <unk> plant <unk>
The gray boxes that you see are control systems in real time.
If we managed to compromise these systems that control speeds and <unk> we can cause a lot of problems with <unk>
The gray boxes don't use <unk> software -- they're completely different technology.
But if we managed to put a cash virus from Windows in a portable computer used by an engineer to set up this gray, then we are ready.
This is the plan behind <unk>
We started with a Windows.
The <unk> enters the gray box hurts the <unk> and the Iranian program is <unk>
It's easy, <unk>
I want to tell you how we discovered this.
When we started to research on <unk> six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing that you knew is that it's very, very complex in the <unk> of <unk> the <unk> used multiple <unk>
It seemed to want to do something with these boxes and these systems of control.
That struck us the attention, and we started an experiment in which we <unk> our environment with <unk> and we saw what happened to this.
So it was very odd things.
<unk> <unk> as a laboratory rat that didn't like our <unk> the wave, but I didn't want to eat.
It didn't make sense for me.
And after experiment with different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, this is a <unk> attack?
It's completely <unk>
The <unk> is actively searching in the gray box if you find a specific configuration, and even if the program that is trying to infect is actually working on that place:
If not, <unk> does nothing.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because we said, "We don't know what the <unk> is.
It could be, let's say, for example, a U.S. power plant, or a chemical plant in Germany.
better than we would take the goal soon.
So we pulled out and <unk> the attack, and we found that it was <unk> in two bombs and a small and a big one.
We also saw that they were highly armed with people who were obviously in the entire internal information.
They were all going to attack.
You probably even know how much it was the operator.
So you know everything.
And if you've heard that <unk> <unk> is complex and high tech, let me tell you, the payload is very complex.
It's very above everything we've seen before.
Here you see a sample of this code of attack.
We're talking about 15,000 lines of code.
It looks pretty much like old language <unk>
I want to tell you how we can find sense to this code.
What we were looking for initially were calls to functions of the system, because we know what they do.
Then we were looking at <unk> and data structures and tried to engage with the real world, with potential objectives in the real world.
We need theories about recipients that we can pass or <unk>
To get to theories about goals, we remember that it's definitely a violent <unk> it must be a valuable, and it's probably in Iran, because it's where most of the infection has been <unk>
They don't find several thousand targets in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear power plant of <unk> and the plant of <unk>
So I said to my <unk> <unk> a list of all the experts in <unk> and power plants between our <unk>
I called them and I asked them in an effort to <unk> their experience with what we found in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we could associate the little digital <unk> with control of the <unk>
rotor is that mobile part inside the <unk> that black object you see.
If they run the speed of this <unk> they certainly can <unk> and even make it <unk>
And what we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to make it slow and <unk> in an obvious effort to go back nuts so that they couldn't solve this very quickly.
We tried to decipher the big digital <unk> looking at very close to the data and its structures.
So for example, the number <unk> stands up in that code, you can't <unk>
I started to research scientific literature about how these <unk> are built in <unk> and I found that they're <unk> in what's called a <unk> and the waterfall contains <unk> <unk>
That made sense, there was a coincidence.
And it got better yet.
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts called stages.
And guess what we found in the code of <unk>
A almost <unk> structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had in their hands.
So there was no <unk> it wasn't like this.
The results have been from a number of hard work.
<unk> <unk> in dead ends.
And yet, we found that both digital <unk> would look at one and same goal, but from different perspectives.
The small <unk> is taking a <unk> and making the <unk> and <unk> and the big <unk> communicates with six <unk> and manipulating <unk>
In <unk> we're very confident that we have given what the <unk> is.
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We should not worry about that other goals are <unk> by <unk>
Here I show you some very interesting things that we just saw, I really <unk>
That's the gray box and the top one you see the <unk>
What this thing is doing is to intercept the values of the sensors for example, of the pressure sensors and the vibration sensors and provides <unk> code, which is still running during the attack, with false data.
And believe it or not, this false entry data is <unk> by <unk>
It's like in the Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the security camera is <unk>
It's great <unk>
The idea here is obviously not just <unk> operators in the <unk>
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital security.
We need digital security systems where a human operator could not act fast.
For example, in a energy plant, when the great steam turbine goes on, you have to open away from escape exhaust.
Obviously this can't do this a human operator, right?
That's where we need digital security.
And when they're <unk> then they can pass bad things.
The plant can exploit.
And neither the <unk> nor the security system is <unk>
That scares me.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This attack is <unk>
It has nothing to see, specifically with <unk> with <unk>
It could work also, for example, in a energy plant, or in a automobile factory.
It's <unk>
And you don't have <unk> <unk> that disseminate this burden with a key <unk> as we saw in the case of <unk>
You could also use conventional technology of worms to <unk>
It was more possible.
And if you made that, with what is <unk> is with a <unk> of mass destruction.
That's the consequence we have to face.
Unfortunately, the biggest number of goals for such attacks is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and in Japan.
All the green areas are spaces with large numbers of goals.
We have to face the consequences and better than we start to prepare now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has been public in many sides that people assume that <unk> is the biggest entity behind this.
What's your <unk>
Ralph <unk> Okay, really want to listen to this?
Yeah. <unk>
My view is that <unk> is involved, but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is the <unk> superpower there.
There is one alone, and that's the United States, fortunately, <unk>
Because, anyway, our problems would be even larger.
CA: Thank you for <unk> Thank you, <unk>
I want you to imagine a robot that can be able to take and give you a little bit of a robot or another thing that makes users from wheels -- you can raise them and walk.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
They're not different from something that gets in the morning, gives you a great force -- which is also increased its speed, and helps you for example, to drive the balance.
It's actually the true integration of man and the machine.
But not just that -- it can integrate it and connect with the universe and with other things that are <unk>
This is not an idea.
So to show you now what we're working on, we started talking about the American soldier who, on average, must take over their back a 45 load of pounds, and it's being allowed to get even more team.
Obviously this leads to some major complications in the back of 30 percent of the soldiers -- with chronic damage from back.
We decided to look at this challenge and create a exoskeleton that could help drive the matter.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> -- or <unk> Human Rights <unk>
Soldier: With the exoskeleton <unk> I can <unk> 90 kilos of mass terrain for many hours.
Their flexible, it allows you to put in <unk> <unk> and running movements with great <unk>
<unk> what I want to do, or where do I want to go, and then it increases my strength and my resistance.
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial partner to produce this device -- this new <unk> this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
So let's look at the users of chairs, about what I feel particularly passionate about it.
There are 68 million people roughly, in <unk> in the world.
Like one percent of the total population.
And this is a really conservative.
We talk about something that happens with a very young people, with damage in the spine that will start their life -- to 20, 30 or 40 years -- collide with a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be its only option.
We also talk about the population that gets <unk> quickly.
Their only option, many times -- a brain injury or some other complication -- is the wheelchair.
And this has been so for the last 500 years, from its successful <unk> as I have to recognize.
So we decided to start by writing a new chapter of mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who was 19 years ago had an injury in the neocortical column, and as a result, he couldn't walk back for 19 years, so far.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk> that <unk>
It's got sensors.
It's completely not <unk> in crutches that send signals to the computer on board on the back.
There are also a little bit of batteries that give the engines on the <unk> and on the knees, and they make it forward with this soft, very natural <unk>
AB: I was about 24 years at the top of my life when, by a stranger jump in the air, skiing it costs down <unk>
In a fraction of a second, I lost all sensation and all <unk> movement.
Shortly after that, a doctor went into my room in the hospital, and he said, "You will never come back to <unk>
That happened 19 years ago.
So I stole up to the last bit of hope of my being.
The technology of adaptation since then, has allowed me to learn to <unk> it costs down the bottom of the <unk> climbing rocks and even assemble the <unk>
But they haven't invented anything that allowed me to walk, until now.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms for sit and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have the whole potential here to change future generations -- not just of soldiers, but to Amanda, and all the users of chairs of <unk> to everyone.
AB: Thank you.
I just returned from a community that has the secret of human survival.
It's a place where women have <unk> they practice sex to say hello, and play is the order of the day -- where the fun is serious.
And no, it's not the festival. Man <unk> or San Francisco.
Ladies and gentlemen, you know their cousins.
This is the world of the wild bonobos of the forests of Congo.
The bonobos are, along with chimpanzees, their closest life.
That means that we all share a common ancestry an evolutionary grandmother, that lived about six million years ago.
Now chimpanzees are known for their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've made too much emphasis on this aspect of human evolution.
But the bonobos show us the other side of the currency.
Whereas chimpanzees are dominated by large, <unk> the society Bonobo is Bonobo in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special because this leads to a very tolerant society where the mortal violence is still not <unk>
But unfortunately, the bonobos are the least <unk> of great apes.
They live in the depths of the rainforest, and it's been very difficult to <unk>
Congo is a <unk> a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of <unk> <unk> scenario in a violent conflict that has been sustained for decades, and caused nearly as many deaths as the First World War.
No wonder that this destruction will also put in danger of the Bonobo.
<unk> meat and deforestation is making you fill in a stadium with the bonobos that are in the world -- and honestly we're not sure about it.
However, in this land of violence and chaos you can hear laughter hidden in the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know them as apes <unk> love, not <unk> because they have <unk> sex and <unk> and <unk> to handle conflict and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all the problems of humanity because the life of bonobos is more than <unk> <unk>
<unk> like humans, they love playing throughout their entire life.
Play is not just a children's game.
For us and the game is fundamental to establish links and foster <unk>
With him we learn <unk> and we learn the rules of the game.
Play increases creativity and resilience and has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity of interactions, diversity of connections.
And when you look at the Bonobo game, you see the roots <unk> the same of the laughter, the dance and the human eye.
The game is the glue that comes together.
I don't know how you play you, but I want to show you a couple of unique videos pulled out of the wild.
First, it's a game game game, and I don't talk about football.
Here's a female and a young male in the middle of a <unk>
Look at what's doing it.
It could be the evolutionary origin of the phrase: <unk> <unk> <unk>
I just think that in this case to him, right?
Yes.
So sexual play is common both in Bonobos like humans.
And this video is really interesting because it <unk> this video really interesting because it shows the invention of bringing unusual elements into play -- like <unk> and also how game requires trust and <unk> and at the same time is the most fun.
But the game is <unk>
The game is <unk> it can adopt many ways, some of which are more <unk> <unk> <unk> maybe the place where the wonder.
And I want you to <unk> this is <unk> a young female who is playing with water <unk>
I think like that, sometimes we played themselves, and explore the boundaries of our inner worlds and outside.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, interact. And then the unexpected connections that we are the real <unk> of creativity.
These are just small samples of the understanding that Bonobos give us from our past and present.
But they also have a secret for our future, a future where we have to adapt to a increasingly difficult and more cooperation.
The secret is the key is the key to these capabilities.
In other words, the game is our <unk>
To adapt to success to a world that changes we have to play.
But let's give it to the most our game capacity.
The game is not <unk>
The game is essential.
To Bonobos and humans, equally, life is not just cruel and <unk>
When it seems less appropriate to play, it can be the moments that is the most <unk>
So fellow primates, we accept this gift of evolution and play together together as <unk> creativity, friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York -- I'm responsible for a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
When I am not fighting poverty, I would say, fires as a <unk> a <unk> <unk>
And in our city, where volunteers allies a highly skilled staff -- you have to get to the fire site very soon to get into action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer on the site, so I had a pretty high probability of going.
But yet there was a race to foot against the other volunteers to get the captain in charge and figure out what our homework was.
When I found <unk> I was <unk> in a conversation with the owner of the owner that has no doubt through one of the worst days of his life.
We were at the full night, she was standing outside in the rain, under a <unk> in his pajamas while his house was on fire.
The other volunteer that I had just got before me, <unk> <unk> --  he got up to the captain and he asked him to go up and save the dog <unk>
The <unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There was a lawyer or a <unk> of money that, for the rest of his life, I would have to tell the people who entered a <unk> building to save a live alive just because I made me for five seconds.
Well, I was the next one.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need to go home.
I need you to <unk> <unk> and bring it to this woman a couple of shoes."
I <unk>
It wasn't exactly what I expected to do, but I was <unk> I got the stairs, at the end of the hallway I went to fire firefighters that at the most or less they had finished off the fire and went into the room for a couple of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my charge back down the ladder where I met my <unk> and the beautiful dog in the front door.
<unk> from the house that was the treasures for the house where, as he would expect, his treasure trove of a lot more attention than mine.
A few weeks later, the department got a letter from his house <unk> by the brave <unk> effort to save her home.
And the kindness that she looked at over the other was that someone had reached even a pair of shoes.
Both in my calling at Robin <unk> as in my calling as voluntary bias, I'm a witness of acts of generosity and kindness on a <unk> scale, but also acts of grace and courage to the individual level.
And you know what I've learned?
It all has its importance.
So when I look at this room to people who have made, or are to make them remarkable levels of success that I'd like to remind you this: <unk>
Don't wait to win the first million to make a difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give, you get now.
<unk> food in an dining room, <unk> a neighborhood.
There are mentors.
Not every day we're going to have the opportunity to save someone else's lives, but each day we're going to influence somebody's life.
So you trained to <unk> the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, comes back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem <unk> but I'm a big fan of the concrete block.
The first concrete blocks built in <unk> with a very simple idea, cement modules from a fixed measure that fit each other.
Very quickly, these became the most used construction unit in the world.
They have allowed us to build things bigger than us, as buildings or bridges or bridges at once.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, <unk> came up with this.
It was called the <unk> brick of <unk>
And in a few years, the <unk> bricks came to every home.
It's estimated that they've made over 400 billion or 75 blocks per person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to build beautiful bridges or buildings or homes.
<unk> made it accessible.
<unk> simply adopted the concrete block in the world, and it turned it into a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, in the Bell labs, the next revolution was to <unk> the new building block.
The transistor was a small plastic unit that would take us from a world of aesthetic and aesthetic <unk> stacked to a world where everything was interactive.
Just like the concrete block of concrete, the transistor allows you to create much bigger circuits and more complex once.
But there's a <unk> difference, the transistor was just to experts.
I personally don't believe that the building blocks of our time are being reserved for experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I began to explore the idea of bringing the power of engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started to develop <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronic modules each with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, sound, motors and sensors.
And the best thing about everything is that they're attached to magnets.
So you can't get the wrong way.
The bricks have a code of colors.
The green is the sun, the blue is the stream, the pink is the entrance and the orange color is the wire.
So you just need to assemble one blue with a green and very quickly you can start making bigger circuits.
One blue with one green is producing light.
Can we put a button in the environment, and we have a <unk>
If we change the button through a pulse, of pulse, that's here, and now we have a light <unk>
We got this <unk> to create more impact, and we have a noise.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, <unk> are actually very powerful.
Instead of having that program, connecting and <unk> <unk> it allows us to program using very simple <unk>
To make it faster or more slow, you just spin this button that makes the pulse faster or slower.
The idea of <unk> is that it's an increased collection of growing.
We want all the interactions in the world to get them into the <unk> to use.
<unk> sound, solar panels, <unk> everything must be accessible.
We have given <unk> to kids to see them playing with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best thing is how they start to understand the electronics of every day that you don't learn in schools.
So for example, how does a light in night, or why the door of an elevator is kept open, or how an iPod responds to touch.
We've also brought to design schools.
So for example, designers without some electronics start playing with <unk> as a material.
Here you can see, with bottles of paper and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
<unk> --  A few weeks ago, we took the designers from the Rhode Island School of Rhode Island designers who don't have an engineering experience, just in cardboard, wood and paper and said, Make something something.
Here's an example of a project that have done, a <unk> cannon on motion.
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a <unk> <unk> that is afraid of darkness.
For these not engineers, <unk> it became another material, electronics became another material.
And we want this material to reach all of us.
So <unk> has open source.
You can visit the website, download all the design files and <unk>
We want to encourage a world of creators, inventors and collaborators because this world in which we live, this interactive world is ours.
So go ahead and make up.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you today about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar technology.
And my little company seeks to get involved with the environment.
Quantum collaboration.
This is a little video of what we do.
<unk> Wait a moment.
You can take a little bit of <unk>
<unk> we can better get the video on one side.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
The solar technology is ...
Oh, I would have the time?
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago, I launched an initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything that is supposed to work on, we asked them to work in government.
The initiative was called <unk> for <unk> and it would be like a <unk> Peace <unk>
<unk> some members every year and put them working with the <unk>
Instead of <unk> the Third World we send the wild <unk>
They made great <unk> they worked with the <unk>
Their task is to show you the possibilities of today's technology.
<unk> <unk>
It's a hydrant in the city of Boston.
So here it appears as if I would find a quote, but what you really look for is that someone has been caught up when you get caught up because he knows that it's not very good by turning fires when it's covered by a meter of snow.
How did he get help in this way so <unk>
Last year in Boston we had a team of members of <unk> for <unk>
They were there in February and at that time we spent a lot last year.
They realized that the city never wiped these <unk>
But one of the members called Erik <unk> I noticed something else: that citizens <unk> <unk> sidewalks right in front of them.
So he did like any good programmer, I developed an app.
It's a nice application in which you can adopt a <unk>
You accept <unk> when you <unk>
When you do that, you put a name, in this case, put it <unk>
If you don't do it, someone can be <unk>
I mean, it has a component playground.
It's a modest application.
Maybe it's the smallest of the 21 killer apps last year.
But it does something that any other technology of the government <unk>
And it extends viral <unk>
A responsible for systems of <unk> city to see this app realized that I could use it, not for the snow, but for citizens to take <unk>
It's very important that these <unk> of the tsunami, but people <unk> the batteries.
So he asks the citizens to <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make the citizens <unk> <unk>
And Chicago just got <unk> to make people <unk> to clean sidewalks when they were <unk>
So now we know about nine cities that we use to use it.
And this has spread out of <unk> and natural and natural way.
If you know a little bit of government technology, you'll know that this doesn't happen normally.
<unk> acquisition takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool for parents to choose the best public school for their children.
Then they told us that I have done the normal channels would have taken at least two and cost about two million dollars.
And that's nothing.
Now there is a project in the power court power that is so far over 2,000 million dollars, and it doesn't work.
And there are projects like this in every level of government.
So an application that program is a couple of days, and it spreads into viral form is a kind of shot of warning to the institution of the government.
It proposes the best ways to work, not as in private enterprises, as many people think it should be.
Not as a technological company, but as well as the Internet itself.
I mean, without <unk> in the open and <unk>
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this app is that it represents the way to address the question of the government that has the new <unk> not as a problem of an <unk> institution but as a collective action.
And that's very good because it turns out we're really good at collective action with digital technology.
And there is a very large community of people who are building the tools so that they were building together with efficacy.
And it's not just <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people all over the country that contribute to applications that are <unk> every day in their own communities.
They haven't been giving up the government.
They feel a great frustration before that but they don't get rid of it.
And these people know something that we lost from view.
And that is that if we leave the feelings about politics, the row in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all those other things that put us <unk> the government is, in essence, in the words of Tim <unk> "What we do together because they don't <unk>
Now a lot of people have left the government.
If you are one of those people, you would ask you, because things are changing.
The policy doesn't <unk> the government.
And because the government ultimately made out of us -- you remember that from <unk> the <unk> the way of thinking about it will affect the way to produce change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought that the government was to choose people to make them <unk>
Well, after two years I've come to the conclusion that the government is, mostly about <unk>
This is the center of health care and information and information.
It's the place that calls calls if you mark <unk> in the U.S.
Scott <unk> this phone call.
He joined <unk> at the base of official knowledge.
I didn't find anything. He started using animal control.
And finally he said, "Hey, you can open up the gates of your house, put it very hard and see if they were <unk>
And it worked. So well by Scott.
But that wasn't the end of the <unk>
Boston doesn't have a call center.
It has a <unk> web and mobile phone called <unk> <unk>
We don't want that application.
It was the work of very clever people in the Office of New York City <unk> from Boston.
One day, this really, comes up this <unk> <unk> in my trash, <unk> I don't know if it's dead.
How do I do it for <unk>
<unk> dynamics is different.
Scott was talking about it.
In <unk> <unk> everything is public, so everybody can see this.
In this case, he saw a neighbor.
The next report said, "I went to the place, I found the garbage behind the house.
<unk> Yes. <unk> Yes.
I went home. I went home.
Good nights, sweet <unk>
Pretty simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of the digital and physical <unk>
And it's also a great example of government income to distributed voluntary collaboration.
But it's also a great example of government as a platform.
And I'm not necessarily talking about the definition of the platform.
I'm talking about a platform so that people will get sick and help others.
So, a citizen helped another but here the government had a key role.
It connected to the two people.
And I could have them connected with the governmental services, but the neighbor is a better alternative and cheapest than government services.
When a neighbor helps each other, <unk> the communities.
If we call animal control, that costs a lot of money.
An important thing we have to think about the government is that it's not the same as politics.
A lot of people get it, but think that one is the entrance to the other.
That our input to the government system is the vote.
How many times have you chosen a political leader, sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader and then we hope that the government <unk> our values and our needs, then we don't see changes.
That is because the government is like an immense and politics is the surface layer of <unk>
That's what we call <unk>
And we say that word with a lot of contempt.
But it's that <unk> that keeps that that belongs to us that that is actually funded as something that is operating in our against that other thing, and we are losing power.
People think that politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work we will have to make the bureaucracy sexy.
Because that's where the real job of government.
We have to collaborate with the machinery of government.
That makes the movement <unk>
They have <unk> them.
It's a group of citizens concerned that have written a very detailed report of pages in response to the request of the <unk> <unk> of <unk> on the financial reform project.
That's not political activism -- it's <unk> activism.
And for those of us who have taken care of government, it's time for us to ask ourselves what world we want to leave our children.
You have to see the huge challenges that they have to face.
They really believe that we will get to where we have to go without solving the institution that can act in <unk>
We can't do any of government, we need it to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible to root the root function so that it can be able to expand <unk> to civil society.
There's a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows that it's not so difficult to act <unk> we just have to articulate the systems in the right way.
The average age of our members is 28 years old, so I am, I'm a greater generation than many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up taking the word and giving that almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face about who's going to <unk> they're all going to talk.
They can express their opinions in any canal at the same time, and they do it.
So when they face the government problem they don't care much about making your voices.
They're using your hands.
They get their hands on the work to program apps to make the government better better.
And those applications allow us to use our hands to improve our communities.
It may be cleaning up a <unk> taking off <unk> dumping a garbage <unk> which has a <unk> inside.
Of course, we were always able to have cleaned up those <unk> and a lot of people do it.
But these applications are like digital <unk> that we are not only consumers, not only we are consumers of government we pay taxes and we get services.
We're more than that: we're citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until we don't know the <unk>
So I want to ask all of you, when it comes to the important things that we have to do together, we will be a swarm of voices, or also we're going to be a crowd of hands?
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in prisons, prisons and death row.
I've spent most of my life in <unk> communities in projects and places where there is a lot of despair.
And being here at TED watching and hearing these stimulus has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things I've noticed in this short time, is that TED has identity.
And the things that tell you here have impact around the world.
On occasion, if something comes from TED, it has a sense and a force that wouldn't have any other way.
I say this because I think identity is important.
Here we have seen fantastic presentations.
And I think we've learned that the words of a teacher can make sense, but if they teach them with feeling, they can have special meaning in it.
A doctor can do good, <unk> if it's <unk> it can get much more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I didn't really learn this in the practice, my job.
I learned from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional house of a <unk> family, dominated by a <unk> which was my grandmother.
It was tough was strong, had power.
It was the last word in the entire family.
She <unk> many of the <unk> in our home.
It was a daughter of people who had been slaves.
His parents were born in slavery in Virginia and <unk>
She was born on the <unk> and his experience with <unk> <unk> the way the world looked like.
She was difficult, but it was also <unk>
When I was a little bit and looked at him, she was approaching me and gave me a good piece of <unk>
I was so hard that I could barely breathe and then get stuck.
One or two hours later, I would come back to me and said, <unk> you still feel my <unk>
And if I said no, I would give me back to me, and if I said yes, I was left in peace.
I had this human quality that would always wish to be near it.
The only problem is I had 10 children.
My mother was the lowest of 10.
On occasion, when I was going to spend a time with her, it wasn't easy to capture his time and her attention.
My cousins were running all over the place.
I remember when I was eight or nine years old, I woke up one morning, I went to the room and there were running out of all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and I looked at me <unk>
I thought it was a game.
And then I looked at it, and I looked at it, but she was very serious.
After 15 or 20 minutes, she stood up, went through the room, and he took me out of my hand, and he said, "Come on. The two are going to <unk>
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I'll never forget.
It took me outside and said, <unk> I'll tell you something, but you can't say it to <unk>
I said, "Okay, let's get <unk>
She said, "Now you know, <unk> I said, "Sure."
Then I sat down, I looked at me and said, "I want you to know that I've been <unk>
And <unk> <unk> that you're <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what you want.
I'll never forget.
Then he said, "Just want me to give me three things: <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "The first thing I want you to talk about is you always want your mother."
<unk> "She is my <unk> and you have to <unk> that always <unk>
As I was <unk> my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk> like that.
Then he said, "The second I want you to tell me is that you will always do the right thing -- even though the right thing is <unk>
I thought about it, and I said, "Yes, <unk>
Then he finally said, "The third thing I want you to tell me is that I never <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk> like that.
I grew up in the field, in southern <unk> I have a brother a year and a sister a younger year.
When I was 14, or 15, one day my brother came home with a <unk> package I don't know where the <unk> took me to my sister and me and went to the forest.
We are just doing <unk> <unk>
He took a drink of beer, he offered my sister, she took a little bit and offered me to me.
I said, "No, no, no. All right. You know, but I'm not going to take <unk>
My brother said, <unk> today -- and you always do the same as us.
I already took something, your sister as well.
I said, "No. I wouldn't feel good. You can <unk>
Then my brother looked at me <unk>
And he said, "What's going on? Take a <unk>
And he looked at me with a force and <unk> "Ah, not that you're still thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tells all the grandchildren that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something that probably shouldn't say.
I know that this is <unk>
But I have 52 years and I can admit that I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I don't say this thinking it's a <unk> I say it by the power of identity.
When we created the right kind of identity, we say things to others who don't really make any sense.
We can't get to do things that they don't think of being done.
I think my grandmother naturally believed that all his grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been a prisoner on the <unk>
My parents died of diseases related to alcohol.
And these were the things that he said, according to her, we should be <unk>
Now, trying to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is very different than what was 40 years ago.
In <unk> there were 300,000 prisoners.
There are 2.3 million.
In the United States, we have the largest incarceration rate in the world.
We have seven million people in parole.
And this massive <unk> in my opinion, has fundamentally changed our world.
In poor communities or black, it finds so much <unk> so much despair, determined by these facts.
One in every three black men between 18 and 30 years is in jail or parole.
In the urban <unk> of all the country, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Baltimore -- 50 to 60 to all young people in color are in jail or parole.
Our system is not just distorted in front of race, it's also about poverty.
In this country, we have a court system, which is a lot better if you're rich and blame, which if you're poor, innocent.
It's not <unk> but wealth which affects the results.
And it seems to us very <unk>
The politics of fear and the anger makes us believe that these are not our problems.
We are <unk>
It seems interesting.
We're looking at our work in our work some pretty curious developments in our work.
In my state, in Alabama, I just like it in other states, you know, whether you have a criminal <unk>
Right now in Alabama, the <unk> of the black population has lost definitely the right to vote.
And if we zoom in to the next 10 years, the level of the loss of rights will be as high as it was before the law of the right to vote.
We have this awesome silence.
I represent children.
Many of my clients are very young.
The United States is the only country in the world where he sentence for 13 years to die in prison.
We have in this country jail for kids, without a chance to go out again.
Right now we're in a process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
They went to people in death row.
This issue of death penalty is interesting.
In a certain sense of us have been asking us to think that the final question is, people deserve to die by the <unk>
A very sensitive question.
But you can think of another way about how we are in our identity.
There's another form of <unk> it's not about deciding whether people deserve to die by the <unk> <unk> but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
The death penalty row is defined by error.
In every nine <unk> people have identified an innocent man who is innocent and liberated from death row.
One of the error, <unk> an innocent one in nine.
This is interesting.
In aviation it would never be allowed to fly airplanes if in every nine than <unk> you would have <unk>
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our struggle.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue if we deserve to kill.
It's interesting that in my classes with students about <unk> history. I talk about slavery.
I talk to you about terrorism, the age that started at the end of the reconstruction and that lasted until the Second World War.
We really don't know a lot about this.
But for the black Americans in this country, it was a defined little bit of terror.
In many communities people were afraid of being <unk>
They were worried about being <unk>
The threat of terror was what defined his lives.
Now there are older people who come to me and say, "Mr. Stevenson, -- you define talks, it makes you <unk> <unk> to the people that stop saying that in our history, for the first time with terrorism, after <unk>
They ask me to say, "No. <unk> we grew up with that."
The age of terrorism was obviously with segregation and decades of racial racial and separation.
In this country, we have a dynamic that we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood the meaning of what historically we've done.
And all the time we went back to each other.
We continuously create tensions and conflict.
It costs us to talk about races. I think it's because we're not willing to engage with a process of truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that you couldn't overcome segregation without a commitment to truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany giving people talking about death.
It was fascinating, because one of the teachers stood after my presentation and said, "You know it's OK to listen to what they <unk>
<unk> "We have no death penalty in Germany.
We will never be able to be here."
The room stayed in silence and a lady said, "There's no way with our history, we could ever get into the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational that we, intentional and <unk> would put us to <unk>
So let's go about this.
How would we feel that in a world where a nation like Germany, and we will engage people, especially if they were mostly <unk>
We couldn't do it.
It would be irrational.
And yet, there is this disconnection.
I think our identity is in danger.
If we don't really care about these issues, the positive things and wonderful things are, however, <unk>
We love innovation.
We are fascinated by technology.
We love entertainment.
But lately, these realities are <unk> by suffering, abuse, <unk> <unk>
In my view, it is necessary to integrate both things.
lately we talked about the need to have more hope, greater commitment, more dedication to the basic challenges of life of this complex world.
I think that means spend more time thinking and talking about the poor, the <unk> the ones that never come to TED.
And thinking about it is, in some ways, something that is inside our being.
It's true that we have to believe in issues that we haven't seen.
So we are. Even though being so rational with intellectual <unk>
The innovation, with innovation -- development is not just the brain ideas.
These things come from <unk> ideas, also by the convictions of the heart.
This is the connection of the mind that drives us to look at not just in the bright and <unk> but also in the dark and hard.
<unk> <unk> the great <unk> leader was talking about this.
He said, "When we were in East Europe suffering from <unk> we wanted all sorts of things, but mostly what we needed was hope, orientation for spirit, a will to be in <unk> sites and being <unk>
Well, that orientation for the spirit is virtually at the heart of what I think even in communities like TED, it must be <unk>
There's no <unk> that is related to technology and design, that allowed us to be truly humans if we don't pay attention to poverty, to <unk> to inequality, to injustice.
Now I want to suggest that these thoughts make up a much more challenging identity than if we ignore these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the great privilege being a very young lawyer, of knowing Rosa <unk>
These women were getting together just to talk.
Occasionally, the lady was called me to go, <unk> comes <unk>
Do you want to come and do it."
I said, "Yes, lady. I do."
So she said, "Well, what are you going to do when you <unk>
I was <unk> <unk>
So I was going and just the <unk>
It was very <unk> very <unk>
And on one occasion I was there, listening to these <unk> and after a couple of hours, Ms. Parks went to me and said, "Now, let me tell me this is that idea of <unk> <unk>
Tell me what you're trying to do."
And I started giving him my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help those who have been doomed to <unk>
We try to confront prejudice and discrimination in the criminal justice administration.
We try to end up with the sentences of life, without freedom to children.
We try to do something about death.
We try to reduce the population in prisons.
We try to end the <unk> <unk>
I gave him all my best speech and he looked at me and said, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
At that time, Mrs. <unk> got my finger on the face and said, "That's why you have to be very much, but very <unk>
I think actually, the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We have to find the way to address those challenges, those problems, that suffering.
Because finally humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been educated in simple things.
I've come to understand and believe that each of us is higher to the worst than we've ever had.
I think that's true for everybody on the planet.
I'm convinced that if somebody says a lie, it's not because it's a liar.
I'm sure if somebody takes something that doesn't belong to you, it's not a <unk>
Even if somebody kills another, it's not a <unk>
So I think there is a basic dignity in the people who must be <unk> by law.
I also think that in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not the wealth.
That's not.
I really think that in many parts the opposite of poverty is justice.
And finally, I think that even though it's very <unk> very beautiful, very <unk> very <unk> we don't judge ourselves for our technology, because of our intellectual capacity or rational.
At the end of the end, the character of a society, not the way they treat rich and powerful people, but because of the way they treat the poor, the doctors <unk> the prisoners.
Because it's in this context as we start to understand truly profound themes about what we are.
I feel <unk> I'm going to end up with a story.
I sometimes make too much force.
<unk> tired, like everyone.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my <unk> in a major way.
I've been representing these guys who have been <unk> with a lot of <unk>
I'm going to prison, and I see my clients of 13 and 14 years old, who have been <unk> so they were <unk>
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can a judge turn to someone in what isn't it?
The judge was <unk> as an adult, but I see a child.
I was very late at night, and I was awake <unk> God, if the judge can become something that you don't say you are, should have magic powers.
Yes, <unk> the judge has magic powers.
You should ask for some of that.
As I was very late, I couldn't think of correctly, but I started working on a <unk>
I had a 14-year-old client a little, poor, white.
I started working on the <unk> with a <unk> that said, <unk> for my <unk> black client to be treated as a high privileged <unk> executive from a <unk>
In the <unk> I put in the <unk> <unk> behavior in the behavior of the police and the process.
There was a <unk> line about how in this country there is no ethical thing, but a whole lack of ethics.
The next morning, I woke up thinking that <unk> <unk> would be a dream, or really <unk>
For my horror, there was not only <unk> but he had sent it to court.
For about two months, I had forgotten it.
And finally he goes, Oh my God, I have to go to court for this case stupid.
I got into the car and I felt truly <unk> <unk>
I went into court.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
I finally got out of the car, walked out to court.
I was going up the stairs when I met a black man -- was the <unk> of the court.
When I saw me, he came up and said, "Who is you?"
I said, "I'm a <unk>
So I was approached and <unk>
And I was standing in the ear, <unk>
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that that was <unk>
That connected to my interior, with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I went into the room of audiences.
When I walked in, the judge saw me.
And he said, "Mr. Stevenson, Stevenson, <unk> <unk>
I said, "I know Mr. <unk> <unk> And we started going.
People started to get there. They were all <unk>
I was the one that had written those <unk>
They got the policemen with the <unk> <unk>
Suddenly, without knowing how, the room was full of people. Everyone furious because we talked about races, because we talked about poverty, because we talked about inequality.
With the <unk> of the eye I got to see the <unk> that was going and <unk>
I looked through the window and <unk> to hear all that <unk>
<unk> walking over here and there.
Finally, this old black, <unk> in the room and sat behind me, almost at the table of lawyers.
About 10 minutes later, the judge was <unk> a <unk>
And during the break, I showed it upset because the <unk> had gone into the room.
The assistant.
And he said, <unk> what do you do in the <unk> room.
And the old black man stood up, looked at the <unk> and he looked at me and said, <unk> to this man room to tell this young man who would keep his view on the target with <unk>
I've come to TED today, because I think many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is very big, but it folds into justice.
We cannot be truly human <unk> if we don't care about human rights and for dignity.
That our survival is linked to each other.
That our visions of technology, design, entertainment.
And above all, to those of you who share this, I just want to tell you to keep the view in the target of <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: <unk> from hearing and see an obvious desire for the audience, of this community, to help in your purposes of doing something.
Something that is not a check. What can we do?
<unk> There are several new opportunities.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there's going to be a <unk> this spring in which you will make an effort to give you the funds you spend today in politics of punishment.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars in death row in the next five years. A billion dollars.
And despite this, the <unk> of the homicide cases not <unk> in <unk>
The <unk> of rapes don't get at all.
Here's a chance of change.
This <unk> is going to propose that these funds are going to make the law of law, to safety.
I think there's a very close opportunity.
CA: There have been a huge decline in <unk> in the United States, in the last three decades.
Part of the reason it is that it has to do with the biggest rate of <unk>
What would you say to those who think that is?
<unk> Actually, <unk> rate has remained relatively stable.
The large growth in <unk> in this country is not due to crimes in violence.
It's because of the wrong war.
That's why this increases in dramatic increases in <unk>
And we let us convince you about the rhetoric of the punishment.
We have three legal causes to bring people to chain <unk> by stealing a bicycle, per small crimes against the property, instead of making them <unk> those resources to their victims.
I think we have to do more to help victims of <unk> and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy about punishment does nothing for anybody.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> have you excited about <unk> today.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for having come to TED. Thank you.

Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips I got in the last six months -- <unk> could be the last six days or the last six years.
The idea is that media media would be <unk> negative news, because our minds pay attention to.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second of each day our senses get a lot of more data than probably the brain can <unk>
And as nothing else matters to us, the first stop of all these data is an old clip of the temporal lobe called <unk>
The amygdala is our early warning detector -- the danger.
<unk> and record.
So from a <unk> of stories, we would look at the negative.
That old saying of <unk> "If there's blood blood, it's very true.
And because all digital devices give us negative news, seven days of week, 24 hours a day, no wonder that we are <unk>
It's not surprising that people think that the world is going to be wrong.
But maybe it isn't.
Maybe instead of what really happens is we get <unk>
Maybe the enormous progress done in the last century because of a series of forces is <unk> so we have the potential to create a world of abundance over the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems -- climate change, the extinction of species, water scarcity and <unk> with no question we have.
As human beings, we are very good at <unk> problems, and in the long time, we end up with them.
<unk> then what happened in the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the average average of life has been more than <unk> the average income per capita tuned for inflation has <unk> around the world.
Child mortality has shrunk 10 times.
Moreover, the cost of food for electricity, of transportation and communications, has fallen from 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve <unk> showed us that we are living the most peaceful age of human history.
And Charles <unk> that the world's literacy happened 25 percent over 80 percent in the last 130 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people do it.
And we continue to get more and higher expectations.
In fact, <unk> the meaning of poverty.
<unk> today in America, much of the people who live under the poverty line have electricity, toilets, toilets, television, television, mobile conditioning and cars.
The <unk> <unk> of the last century, the <unk> on the planet, would never have dreamed of such <unk>
It is a lot of the technology and lately, its exponential growth.
My good friend Ray showed that any tool that we had in information technology jumps into this curve, Moore's Law, and doubling the price of the price for about 12 to 24 months.
So the mobile phone that you have in your pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer in the '70s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to look at two things in this curve.
First, how soft it is -- on good and bad time in war and peace in peace and <unk>
It's the wind of fast computers used to build faster computers.
It doesn't stop before any of the great challenges.
And even though it's <unk> in a law on the left, it goes up.
The growth rate of technology is increasingly faster.
And on this curve, to Moore's Law, there's a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we tell today.
The computation in the cloud, that my friends in <unk> call infinite computation and sensors and robotics -- 3D printing and its ability to democratize and distribute personalized production on all of the planet, synthetic biology, the fuels and the <unk> the <unk> and the <unk>
I mean, how many of you saw victory <unk> <unk>
It was <unk>
I searched for the newspapers the best headline that I had.
And I loved this: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
"Jeopardy" is not an easy game.
Play with the most complex human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available for all on your phone.
Four years ago, here at TED, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new university called <unk> <unk>
We teach these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can you be used to solve the great challenges of humanity.
And each year we asked them to release a company, or a product or service, that can affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students today can impact a billion people.
Thirty years ago that would have been <unk> absurd.
Today we can point out a <unk> of companies that have already done before.
When I think about creating abundance, it doesn't mean to create <unk> life for every single one of the planet, this is about creating a life of as possible.
It is about taking that that's nice and making it <unk>
You see, scarcity is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
I'll give you an example.
It's a story of Napoleon <unk> in the <unk>
He's the guy on the left.
<unk> to dinner the king of <unk>
The troops of Napoleon ate with <unk> and the same <unk> with gold.
But the king of <unk> ate with aluminum <unk>
You see, aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet, as much as gold and <unk>
That's why the tip of the Washington Monument, is aluminum.
You see, even though aluminum is the <unk> of the Earth, it doesn't come as a pure metal here.
It's tied to oxygen and <unk>
But then the <unk> came up and made it something so cheap that we use it as if it was <unk>
<unk> this analogy to the future.
Let's think about energy shortage energy.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are on a <unk> planet for 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They come to the Earth 16 energy <unk> every 88 minutes.
It's not about graphics, but <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar energy in India is 50 percent less than the generated of the generated <unk> rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar energy dropped 50 percent last year.
Last month, MIT published a study that shows that at the end of the decade, in the U.S. parts of the United States, electricity will cost six cents an hour of hour compared to the 15 cents of national average.
And if we have abundance of energy we also have abundance of water.
Let's talk about wars in the water.
Do you remember when Carl Sagan pointed out the Voyager spacecraft to the Earth, in 1990, after the country happened.
I got a very famous photo. How do you <unk>
"A <unk> <unk> <unk>
Because we live on a planet's planet.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent of water.
Yes, the <unk> is saltwater, two percent is ice, and we fought the <unk> of the water on the planet, but also there is a hope.
It's an available technology not in 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes the nanotechnology, the <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators in the <unk> I would like to share with you, gave me permission to tell you, your technology called <unk> <unk> <unk> is the size of a small fridge size of a small refrigerator.
It is able to generate a thousand liters of drinking water on the day of any source source, saltwater, contaminated water, a <unk> for less than two cents a gallon.
The president of Coke just thought that I will do an important test of hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out right, and I have full confidence in which it will be -- Coca-Cola is going to implement it in <unk> countries on the planet.
This is an amazing innovation for this technology that today.
And we've seen it on mobile phones.
My God, we're going to get to 70 percent penetration penetration in the developing world by 2013.
<unk> that warrior <unk> has better mobile communications.
And to tell with a smartphone with Google, has access to more knowledge and information than President Clinton 15 years ago.
She lives in a world of abundance of information and communications that nobody could have happened.
So better than that, the things that you and I have paid tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- <unk> video -- images of books and music, <unk> diagnostic technology -- now <unk> and lose value of market <unk>
Maybe the best thing to get when you get the app on health.
Last month, I had the pleasure to announce with the <unk> Foundation, which is something called the X <unk> <unk> <unk>
We are challenging the teams of the world so that we are challenging these technologies in a mobile device that they speak, and because it has <unk> they can be extracted from your finger.
To win has to make better diagnoses than a certificate.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors, where the payload of <unk> is 25 percent of the health workers of health.
When this device <unk> a RNA virus or DNA that we won't call it a <unk> and first of all, prevent the pandemic.
But this is the biggest force to produce a world of abundance.
I call it the billion <unk>
The white lines here are the population.
We just got the brand of seven billion.
By the way, the best protection against the population explosion is to give the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connecting them.
By 2020, we'll move from two billion to five billion Internet users.
Three billion minds were never before the global conversation.
What are these people?
What a <unk>
And instead of economic collapse, we will have the greatest economic injection of history.
These people represent tens of trillions of dollars <unk> in the global economy.
And <unk> of more health from the <unk> of a better education with the Academy Academy -- and because of the use of 3D impressions and computation in the cloud will be more productive than ever before.
What can we provide three billion more members of humanity, healthy and <unk>
How about voices never before <unk>
What if we give them to the oppressed, wherever they are, a voice to be heard, and being able to act for the first time?
What about these 3,000 dollars?
And if they are contributions we can't afford to.
One thing that I learned with the X X is that small equipment guided by their passion with an objective of of course, can do things like this, things that could only make large corporations and governments.
I'm going to end with sharing a story that really bothers me.
There's a program that maybe some have heard of them.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how you fold the protein.
<unk> determine the structure and functionality.
It's really important in medical research.
And so far, it was a problem of <unk>
They've played this with this college university -- among others.
Then hundreds of thousands of people joined and started <unk>
And it's shown that today the machine recognition machinery is better folding proteins than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me a huge confidence in the future is that we have more power to take the great challenges of the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the passion for the innovator <unk>
We have the capital of the <unk>
And we have three billion new minds that we are becoming excited about to work on the solution of the big challenges and do what we should do.
We have in front of some extraordinary decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very <unk> idea.
<unk> of the point of <unk>
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, before I give you three examples to make time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
Maybe they believed that <unk> <unk> but it wasn't.
It actually <unk> fish.
And he described one of them as a <unk>
It was the <unk>
It was caught up to the <unk>
Now the fish is in the Red <unk>
But we've heard this story many times, about Galapagos and other places, so that has nothing special about it.
But the case is that we still come in the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
The leaflets are still saying that they're still <unk>
So what about here?
The second story, also illustrates another concept.
Because I was there in <unk> studying a water in West Africa.
He was there because I grew up in Europe and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought it could be <unk>
I burned a lot with the sun and I was convinced that I was not there.
This is my first exhibition in the sun.
The water was surrounded by <unk> and, as you can see, from a <unk>
There was <unk> from about 20 meters, a black beard <unk>
And the fishery of this <unk> was very abundant and spent for a good moment, so I was earning more than the average in Ghana.
When I went there 27 years later, the number of fish had declined to half.
It was <unk> in <unk>
They would start a genetic pressure.
There was still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
I mean, nothing to changed, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was guilty in the introduction of <unk> fishing in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970s -- <unk> started in <unk> Europe did a lot of development projects.
The fishing development was imposing the countries that had already 100,000 <unk> <unk> industrial fishing.
And this boat, pretty cool was called <unk> four.
I went out to fish in him, and we did studies in the southern Sea of the China <unk> and, above all, in the Sea, <unk>
What we captured was something <unk>
<unk> I know, the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we'd capture was <unk> other animals in the background.
And most of the fish are blobs of the tiny ones about <unk> remains fish from coral reef fish.
In short, the bottom of the sea came to the deck and then it was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast.
In one year, you do a study and then you start commercial fishing fishing.
The background is going to be a solid coral fund in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a <unk>
Not the <unk> <unk> because they were dead.
We once captured a alive.
I was still not <unk>
So they wanted to be <unk> because it was a good food.
This mountain mountain is what they collect every time they go to an area where they have never fish.
But there is no <unk>
We <unk> the world, but we don't remember it.
It <unk> the starting point, the new level, without remembering what was there.
If you look at this something like this.
On the y-axis we have <unk> biodiversity, we have a number of killer <unk> the <unk> of the country, the water supply.
And that changes over time. It changes because people do things with <unk>
Each generation will use the images in the beginning of their conscious life as the normal thing and just extrapolate forward.
The difference is that they perceive loss of loss.
But they don't pick up the loss that happened before.
You can analyze the accumulation of changes.
And at the end of the end of the <unk> <unk>
And that is largely what we want to do now.
We want to keep things that no longer are, or they're not what they were.
But you should think that this problem is affecting people when the societies -- kill animals without knowing what they've done to some generations later.
Because, obviously, an animal that is very abundant before <unk> it's <unk>
You don't lose animals.
You lose a little bit of common.
Even if this is not perceived as a big loss.
Over time, we focus on big animals, and in a charge of large fish.
They become <unk> because the <unk>
We have a few fish, but we think that's the point of <unk>
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, we don't know that it was different.
In fact, many people, scientists, <unk> that was very different.
And they will do it because the evidence presented in an earlier way, is not the way they would expect that to have the evidence.
So for example, the anecdote that some of the <unk> as a captain just looked at a lot of fish in this area cannot be used or usually not using the scientists of fishing, because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we lived in <unk> societies, because they don't rely on the sources of the past.
And there is the enormous role that can make a protected marine area.
Because with the protected protected areas, we really recreated the past.
I think about the past that people cannot conceive of because the starting point has run and is extremely low.
That's for the people who can see a protected marine zone, and they can benefit from the vision that we want, which allows them to erase their point in.
And what about the people who can't do it because they have no access, like the people in the West, for example?
I think there and the arts and cinema maybe can fill the vacuum. The simulation.
This is a simulation of the Bay Bay Bay
A long time ago there were gray whales in the Bay bay 500 years ago.
And you may have noticed that <unk> and <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think about how people are being moved with the movie <unk> I will talk about the story of <unk> why do you <unk>
Because it raises something that, in a sense, it has been lost.
So my <unk> the only one that is giving, is to Cameron, do <unk> <unk> underwater.
Thank you very much.
Hi. I'm Kevin <unk> the <unk> trends of <unk> and I look at YouTube videos.
It's true.
So today, we're going to see why videos are making viral and what importance has that.
We all want to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> When I was younger, that seemed very, very hard to do.
But today, the web video makes any of us, or of our actions, it leads to a part of our global culture.
Anybody can be famous on the Internet in a <unk>
Over 48 hours of video to YouTube a minute.
And of those, only one small percentage gets viral gets countless visits and wins cultural <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: creators of engaging communities and factor.
Okay, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh my God, my God.
My God!
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this video filmed outside his house in the National Park.
In 2010, it was 23 million times.
This graph shows the views on the rise of the past summer.
<unk> was not proposed to make a viral video.
I just wanted to share a double rainbow.
That's what you do if it's called <unk> Mountain <unk>
They had already published many videos of nature.
This video was published in January.
So what happened here?
It was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> published this plea that he was going to be <unk>
<unk> of trends like Jimmy <unk> are presented to us and interesting things and <unk> them to a wider audience.
RS: <unk>  It's Friday, Friday. You have to start on Friday.   Everybody wants me to come up for a week, the weekend.
<unk> from Rebecca is one of the most popular videos in the year.
You saw it nearly 200 million times this year.
This graph shows the frequency of use.
Just like <unk> days, this video seemed to be emerged from nothing.
So what happened this day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask those other <unk> they are also Friday.
But what happened this day, this Friday <unk>
Well, he took <unk> and many blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. <unk> from <unk> Science <unk> was one of the first people to make a joke on Twitter.
But the important thing is that a person or an creators take a point of view, and they share it with a broader audience, accelerating the process.
So this community of people who share this big inner joke then start talking about that and doing things.
And now there are 10,000 <unk> on YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parody for each of the other days.
Unlike the <unk> entertainment of the 20th century, this communal engagement is our way to be part of the phenomenon or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is an engineered animation with a <unk> music.
That's it.
This year you saw it about 50 million times.
And if you think that's rare, you know that there is a three hours that has seen four million times.
Until cats saw this video.
And there are cats that you saw other cats will see the video.
But the important thing here is the creativity I woke up between the Internet <unk>
There was <unk>
Somebody made one version of the old one.
And then it became international <unk>
Suddenly a whole community of <unk> that made it happen to be a dumb joke, to something that we can all become part.
Because today not just <unk> <unk>
Who could have predicted something like this?
Who might have predicted <unk> <unk> or RS: <unk> or <unk> <unk>
What script might have been written by this situation?
In a world where two days of video would go up two days a minute, just the only thing and unexpected can be <unk> the way these things have done it.
When a friend told me that I had to see this great video of a guy who was protest against <unk> <unk> in New York, I admit that I was not interested in too much.
Casey Casey <unk> I am <unk> by not circular by <unk> but often there are obstacles that prevent you circular from the <unk>
KA: Thanks to the surprise and its humor, Casey <unk> managed to get five million seeing and understand their idea.
So this approach is worth all of the new things that we do differently.
And all of this leads us to a great question.
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
The creators for creative communities, and the totally unexpected, are features of a new type of media -- of a new culture, that we all have access and is the audience that defines the <unk>
As I said before, one of the current celebrity in the world, Justin Justin began on YouTube.
I don't have permission to express your ideas.
Now we're all kind of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of the old media features -- it's just the current means -- but we will make it <unk> the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that's still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a lifetime.
This is a poet, a man whose entire life had been supported in the single hope of unity and freedom of his country.
<unk> as the <unk> come into <unk> <unk> the fact that his life had been totally in vain.
The words, for so long friends, I'm now going to do it.
It was <unk> in silence.
He died broken by history.
He's my grandfather.
I never met him.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother was never allowed to forget his story.
My task was not to let that have been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that the story tried to try and figure it out.
The next part of the puzzle is a boat at dawn <unk> <unk> to the sea.
My mother, <unk> was as only 18 years old when his father died, and a <unk> marriage, two little girl.
For her, life had been destined for a task -- the escape.
It was <unk> for her that I couldn't do it.
And after a <unk> four years that challenges the fiction, a <unk> was so slid into the sea <unk>
All the adults knew the risks.
The biggest fear of fear was the rape and death.
Like most of the adults, my mother was wearing an <unk> with poison.
If we were asked first, we would take my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the constant rate of the motor, <unk> <unk> on every wave, and the vast horizon, vacuum and empty.
I don't remember the hackers who came several times, but they were <unk> with the bravery of men on our boat, or the dead, dying and not being able to break for six hours.
But I know the lights of the operating platform in front of the coast of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and died, finished the journey was too much to it; and the first apple that I tried to, given for men on the platform.
No apple had the same flavor.
After three months in a refugee camp, <unk> in <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four of three women making a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a <unk> <unk> whose population is comprised of immigrants from immigrants in <unk>
Unlike the middle class in the middle class whose existence I <unk> in <unk> there was no sense of the right.
The smells that came from stores were from the rest of the world.
And the fragments of English <unk> <unk> among people who had one thing in common: they were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, then on a car assembly line, working six days, double turn.
Yet, I found time to study English and get a degree in I.T. IT to <unk>
We were poor.
And all the dollars were <unk> and they established an extra <unk> in English and mathematics, it wouldn't matter what it should be, which was usually <unk>
Two pairs of <unk> for school, one to hide the holes in the other.
A school uniform to the <unk> because he had to last six years.
And there were rare <unk> and <unk> on the <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk> <unk>
At home, where?
Something in me is <unk>
I was <unk> and a voice that said, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I <unk> in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we moved on to us on our day and <unk> our grandmother's movements.
My mother suffered <unk> all of the ship.
And my task was to be wake up until his nightmares began to be able to do it.
She opened a computer store, and then I studied to be <unk> and opened another business.
And the women were coming with their stories about men who couldn't do the magnificent and angry transition and <unk> boys trapped between two worlds.
It looked for subsidies and <unk>
And they created centers.
I lived in worlds.
In one, it was the classic Asian student, relentless with what I would benefit from myself.
On the other, I was <unk> in everyday lives, sweating <unk> by violence, drug abuse and isolation.
But many people got help over the years.
And for that work, when I was studying my last year, I chose the youth Australian young year.
And I was <unk> from a piece of the puzzle to the other, but the edges of <unk>
As a resident resident in <unk> was now as <unk> refugee and social activist and activist social activist who had never heard of <unk> and in houses whose existence would never have imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retreat into the <unk> and comfort in life in a suburb -- a grandmother, a mother, a mother, a mother and two daughters finishing up the day as they did for nearly 20 years, <unk> on the day of every single bed.
And I told my mom that I couldn't do it.
It reminded me that I had now the same age that she had when we got the boat.
The unable ever had ever been an option.
<unk> said to me, "Don't be what you don't know.
So I talked about <unk> youth and education and <unk> to the marginalized and <unk>
And the more frankly talking, the more it was <unk> to speak.
I met people from all the roads in life, many of them doing what we were living on on the border of as possible.
And although I finished my <unk> I realized I couldn't stay on a <unk> career.
I had to have another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's okay to be an unknown, a new wine in the scene -- and not only it's fine, but it's something that will be grateful, maybe a gift of the ship.
Because being inside it can easily mean <unk> <unk> can easily mean to accept the assumptions of your <unk>
I gave enough steps outside my happy zone to know that, yes, that the world was <unk> but not the way we fear of.
<unk> that would not have been <unk> they were tremendously.
There was an energy there, an unrealistic optimism -- a rare mix of humility and <unk>
So I kept my intuition.
<unk> to a small group of people for whom the motto cannot be <unk> was a <unk> challenge.
For one year, we didn't have a <unk>
At the end of each day, I was doing a giant pot of soup that all <unk>
<unk> up to the night.
The majority of our ideas were mad, but some brilliant, and we opened up.
He made the decision to move to the U.S.
After one journey.
My <unk>
Three months later I had <unk> and the adventure.
Before I finish, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time where the <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person who cared.
Life hadn't changed for centuries.
His father died shortly after she was born.
The mother grew up alone.
A <unk> became a <unk> whose mother <unk>
Without the support of his husband, it caused an <unk> to <unk> and getting the cause she himself, and much more <unk> caused when I won.
You can't have it proved to be wrong.
I was in the shower in a hotel room in <unk> when she died, <unk> <unk>
I looked through the <unk> of the shower and I saw it on the other side.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother called minutes later.
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple in <unk> and we sat around his <unk>
We tell stories, and we made sure we were still with it.
At night a monk came up and told us that I had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to <unk> her hand.
I asked the <unk> "Why his hand is hot, and the rest of the body is so <unk>
"Because you have taken your hand from the <unk> he said.
"You haven't got it.
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through women.
Since we were and how life came to us, we can now see that the men who would have come to our lives would have <unk>
<unk> would be very easily.
Now I want to have my own kids, and I wonder about the boat.
Who might want that to you?
However, the privilege of the easy thing to do.
I can give you a <unk> in your lives, by diving bold in each wave, the <unk> rate of the engine, the vast horizon that doesn't guarantee nothing?
I don't know.
But if I could give them and see them safe, I would do it.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of this is here today, in the fourth or fifth row.
My story starts in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, in the <unk> sky, with the singer, <unk> <unk>
We were a conversation about how nothing has changed from the time of the ancient Indian <unk> "The <unk>
In those days when the Indians wanted to travel <unk> to a car and cut the sky.
Now we do it with airplanes.
At that time when he <unk> the great Prince Indian, Indian, I had <unk> I had a <unk> and with a <unk> to the floor, he got water.
We now do the same with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion that we took was that the machinery had replaced the magic.
And that was very excited to me.
Every time I felt a little bit more about <unk>
And I was going to tell you this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciating a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't tell my friends.
It seemed like the technology had to allow the magic to let the magic, don't happen.
As a child, my grandfather gave me his <unk> silver <unk>
And this piece of 50 years was to my most magical thing.
It became a golden door to a world filled with pictures, from hackers and <unk> in my imagination.
I had the feeling that the mobile phone, the <unk> and the cameras prevent them from <unk>
<unk> our inspiration.
That's why I was <unk> I was sent to this technological world to see how we use it to create magic, instead of <unk>
I took books from the age of 16.
So when I saw the iPad, I saw a device of narrative able to connect the readers of the whole world.
Can we know how we take the book.
Where do we are.
They put the text with the picture, animation, animation, sound and touch.
<unk> becomes more and more <unk>
But what is it for us?
I'm about to launch an interactive app for the iPad.
It says, <unk> your fingers on every light."
And so ...  He says, "This box belongs <unk> I write my name.
And so I get a character from the book.
In several moments, a <unk> -- the iPad knows where I live because of GPS -- that comes led to me.
My inner child gets excited about all these possibilities.
I've talked a lot about magic.
And I don't mean <unk> and dragons but to that magic magic to those ideas that we <unk>
For some reason, fireflies in a jar were always to me exciting.
So over here, we have to shift the iPad to release fireflies.
And really, they light up your way in what it is.
Another idea that I was fascinated by as a child was that a whole galaxy <unk> in a <unk>
So here, every single book and every world becomes a <unk> that I drag into this magical device inside the device.
And this opens up a map.
In every fantasy fantasy there has always been maps but it's been static maps.
This is a map that grows, <unk> and guide you over the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book they also <unk>
Now I'm going to go in.
Another incredibly important aspect for me is to create Indian content, and to contemporary content.
These are the <unk>
We've all heard of <unk> and <unk> but how many people were out of India know their counterparts in India, the <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in the cameras of Indra for millennia, in an old and <unk> book.
That's why we're bringing it back into a child history.
In a story that deals with current issues like the environmental crisis.
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems of the last 10 years has been that kids have been attached to their <unk> they haven't come to the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can take our kids into the natural world with its technology.
One of the interactions in the book is this adventure that we have to go outside the outside, take the camera or the iPad, and collect images of different natural objects.
As a child, I had a lot of <unk> stones, <unk> and <unk>
For some reason the kids don't do it.
So to recover this childhood ritual, you have to go out and in a chapter, you have a photo to a flower and then get it away.
So in another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex, and then you get it.
So it creates a digital collection of pictures that then you can put on the Web.
A boy in London puts a picture of a <unk> and he says, "Oh, I saw a <unk>
A boy of India says, "I saw a <unk>
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital pictures that have been taking.
Within the variants of connection between magic, Earth and technology there are many possibilities.
In the next book, we have an interaction where you get out with the iPad and the video on and through it on and using augmented reality, you see a group of <unk> cartoons that appear on the inner plants of the house.
And at a moment the screen is full of leaves there.
And you have to make the sound of the wind and try to make the sound of the book.
We're going to a world where the forces of nature will relate to technology and magic and technology come to each other.
<unk> the energy of the sun.
We're approaching our children and ourselves the natural world and that magic, <unk> and love that we sit through a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about why many projects of <unk> <unk>
And I think, really, that the most important thing about that is we stop listening to patients.
And one of the things we did at the University of <unk> was <unk> to a head of listening.
And not in a very scientific way, she raised a little cup of coffee or you and asked patients, and I asked patients, what do you do?"
"How can we <unk>
And we tend to think that this is one of the biggest problems for what all of all, or maybe not all, but most of the projects of <unk> fail because we stop listening.
This is my scale. It's a very simple thing.
It has a <unk> and closed line.
Every morning I was <unk>
And yeah, I have a challenge as you can see.
I got the challenge to reach 95 percent <unk>
But it is so simple that every time I got up, sends my information to Google <unk>
And my doctor of <unk> has access to him as well. And he can see what my weight problem is, not at the same time when it needs assistance to you or some urgency of that that, but to see it backwards.
But there's something else.
Like some of you know, I have more than 4,000 followers on Twitter.
So every morning I connect to my level Wi-Fi and before you go up to my car, people start to <unk> <unk> today I think you need a light lunch.
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's pressure from the pairs used to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also for patients stop smoking.
On the other hand, it can be <unk> to move people out of their chairs and together to develop some activity <unk> to have more control of their health.
From next week, I will be available.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or a device.
And people would take away from their homes, to take their blood pressure, they get to their doctor, and share it with others, for example, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume a position, come back to recover control and being captains of their own <unk> but it also can help us care about health because of the challenges we face -- like the firing of the costs of attention, the <unk> of demand and other issues.
It was a techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients in the team.
And you can do it with techniques like these, but also by <unk>
And one of the things we did like to share with you with you with a video.
We all have navigation controls in the <unk>
Maybe even we have our cell phones.
We know perfectly where ATM machines are in <unk>
Where are all the <unk>
And of course, we can find fast food chain.
But where is the nearest <unk> to help this patient?
We asked it, but nobody <unk>
Nobody knew where to get <unk> saves lives right now.
What we did was we do <unk> in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the audience to see a <unk> please look at it, and when it's open, because when it's open, that sometimes open up in <unk> office and others are closed.
And over 10,000 <unk> they were already introduced in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for the application for that.
And we did an application for the iPad.
We created an application for <unk> reality.
And every time you're in the city of <unk> and somebody else can use your iPhone, and to the next few weeks to use their cell phone cell phone to find the nearest <unk> which can save lives.
And from today, I would like to introduce this one, not just as <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also as <unk>
And we want to go on the global level.
We are attached to all of the colleagues in the world, in other universities, so that we will help us find, work and act like a center for the <unk> of the <unk> around the world.
Every time you're on vacation and somebody else can be a relative or somebody in front of you, can find it.
I also want to invite companies around the world that could help us digitize these <unk>
They could be text messaging or people in <unk> for example, to see if the <unk> that shows is still in their place.
Please keep it in this and not just improve health, but take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share <unk> photograph.
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because, of course, it's photographs that can't take with your cameras.
My interest for photography was awakened to my first digital camera at age 15 years.
I mixed with my early passion before but it was a little bit different because of using the camera the process was in planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera the process ends up when you press <unk>
To me, photography had more to do with being in the right place, at the right time.
It looked like anybody could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that would start by pressing the <unk>
<unk> like this: a construction on a very <unk>
But it has an unexpected turn.
And despite it, it keeps a level of <unk>
Or pictures like <unk> dark and colorful pictures at the time, but with the common goal of keeping the whole level of <unk>
And when I say realism I say <unk>
Because, of course, it's not something I can do, but I always want it to look like it is captured in some way like photograph.
And I think you have to think about a moment to discover the trick.
It has more to do with capturing an idea that has a moment.
But what is the trick that makes them look true.
That's the details or the <unk>
Put the light?
What do you create <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is perspective.
But in the end, it is about our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive it on a <unk> surface.
It's not really about whether it's realistic but what we think is realistic.
So I think the foundations are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of the reality where we took different pieces of reality and put them together to create an alternative reality.
I'll show you a simple example.
Here we have three perfectly <unk> objects that we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined in a certain way can create something that still seems to be <unk> as if we were.
But at the same time, we know it doesn't exist.
So let's go to the brain because the brain doesn't embrace the fact that it doesn't really make sense.
And I see the same process by combining the pictures.
That's really about combining different <unk>
And the things that make a picture look realistic I think they're those in which we don't even get the things around us in our everyday lives.
But when we combine photographs it's very important to <unk> because otherwise something is going to look bad.
So I'd like to say that there are three simple rules that will continue to achieve realistic results.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of photos must have the same perspective.
Second, the pictures -- they have to have the same kind of light.
And these two images fill with these <unk> were taken at the same height and with the same kind of light.
The third point is making impossible to distinguish the principle and the end of the different images with a perfect child.
It has to be impossible to see where the picture.
This is another example.
You might think that this is the image of a landscape and the bottom is <unk>
But this image is totally composed of different places.
And I think it's easier to create a place that it seems to be <unk> because you don't need to put the ideas that has in your head.
But it requires a lot of planning.
And as I thought this idea in the winter I knew I had several months to try to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured on a fishing journey.
The coast are a different location.
The <unk> was captured in a shaft of stone.
And yes, I even made red the house of the top of the island to look more <unk>
So to get an realistic outcome of it -- I think it takes planning.
It always starts with an idea.
Then we have to combine all the different pictures.
And here every piece is very well <unk>
If you do a good job by taking the pictures the outcome can be very beautiful, and at a very realistic.
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'll start showing you a slide about technology, very boring.
Please if you can <unk>
This is a diagram that I took from a folder and mine.
I'm not really interested in showing you the details, but the general look at it.
This is an analysis that we were doing about the power of <unk> <unk> versus the power of local area networks.
The interesting thing about this is that this one, like many other we tend to see, is a straight line on a <unk> scale.
In other words, every step here represents an order of magnitude on the scale scale.
I'm going to talk about technology with <unk> curves is something new.
Here's something weird happens.
And that's exactly what I'm going to talk about.
Please turn the lights.
It <unk> more intensity than writing on paper.
Why do we create technological curves at <unk> scales.
The answer is that if you draw it into a normal curve where, say, these are the years, or some unit of time, and this would be any measure of the technology that I'd like to take on the diagram would look something ridiculous.
It would be something like this.
It doesn't tell a lot.
But if you look at some other technology, like transportation, in a <unk> curve, it would be very silly, we would see a straight line.
But if something like this, like this, it gives you a <unk> change.
If the technology of transportation would be as fast as the last <unk> the last morning we could take a cab and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't go through that rate.
There's no precedent in the history of technological development that every few years advance of magnitude.
The question I want to do is -- looking at these curves -- we see that they don't still forever.
It's not possible to hold this change as fast as it goes.
I took one of two things.
Or well it will become a typical curve. I know like this until something completely different, or maybe I'll do something like this.
That's all that can happen.
I'm optimistic, and I think maybe something like this.
Of course, we're going to be in the middle of a transition.
In this line we're in a transition from what the world used to be the world, in a new way.
So what I'm trying to ask, and ask me, what is that new way <unk>
Where new state is the world?
The transition seems very, very confused if we're engaged in it.
I remember that the future is happening in the year 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future, and we see that the future is still the year 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has <unk> year after year, throughout my life.
But I think it's because we feel that something is going on.
That happens that a transformation.
And we know that it doesn't have a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years because it's all going to be so different to extrapolate what we're doing today doesn't make any sense.
So I want to talk to you about how it might be, how that transition to <unk>
But to do that will have to talk a little bit about things that don't have a lot to do with technology and computer technology.
Because I think the only way to understand it is taking distance and look at things in the long term.
The scale of time I would like to do this is the time of life on Earth.
I think this image makes sense if we look at it every billion years.
So we go back around about two and a half billion years when the Earth was a huge sterile rock with many chemicals that would go around it.
If we look at the way those chemicals <unk> we give us an idea of how things happened.
And I think there are theories to start understanding the origin with RNA. I'm going to tell you a simple version of this, and that is, at that time, there was a <unk> of oil with all sorts of chemical recipes inside.
Some of those drops of oil held a particular combination of chemicals that made them bring materials from the outside and so <unk> grew up growing up.
And they started <unk>
In a sense, those were the most important cell shapes -- those oil <unk>
But those drops weren't alive, in the current sense, because each one of them contained a random recipe for chemicals.
And every time you <unk> it <unk> a <unk> distribution of the chemicals that we make.
So every <unk> was a little different.
In fact, drops that somehow <unk> being better at the time to incorporate chemical <unk> more and more chemicals and more <unk>
Mostly they lived longer, they were more <unk>
It was a form of life, chemistry -- very simple, but things got interesting things when these blobs learned the trick of abstraction.
Somehow we don't really understand these <unk> learned to store information.
They learned to save information, which was the recipe for the cell -- in a special chemist called DNA.
In other words, <unk> in this meaningless evolution -- a writing system that allowed them to record what they were in order to be able to get it.
The amazing thing is that that writing system seems to have remained stable since it evolved two billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes, they have exactly the same code, that same writing system.
In fact, every living is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things that I just did for you: Now we can write things with this code.
Here I have 100 <unk> of white dust that I try to hide to the airport.
But <unk> I took this <unk> The code has the common letters that we tend to use on this -- and I wrote my personal data on this piece of DNA and put it up 10 to 22 times.
So if somebody wants 100 million copies of my personal card -- I have a lot of them for all the <unk> in fact, for every person in the world, and it's here.
If it was a <unk> I would have put it in a virus and have it spread through the room.
What was the next <unk>
Writing DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells become happy about another billion years.
But then there was another big step in which things became very different and was that these cells began to exchange and communicating information to forming cells.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
So for example, for example, it evolved antibiotic resistance.
Some bacteria found the way we avoid penicillin, and they were <unk> to create their small DNA with other bacteria and now there are many resistant to penicillin because bacteria communicate.
This communication gave place to make communities that in a way, they were together in a way, and a <unk>
So <unk> or <unk> together, or if a community was very successful all the individuals of that community, they were more and they were <unk> by evolution.
And the point of inflection happened when these communities came together so that in fact, they came together and decided to write all the recipe for the community on a DNA chain.
The next interesting stage for life took another billion years.
And at that stage, we have communities that are <unk> communities of many different cells working together as a single organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have a lot of cells that don't just act alone.
The skin cell doesn't serve without the heart of the heart, or the brain or the brain, and so on.
So these communities evolved and made more interesting levels than cell phone, something we call a organism.
The next level happened within these communities.
These started <unk> information.
And to build very special structures that they didn't do more than process information in community.
They're <unk> structures.
The neurons are the devices that process the information that these built cell communities built.
In fact, they started <unk> within the community being the responsible structures of <unk> understanding and transmit information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that moment as <unk> learning was confined to the length of an organism, and not the period of evolutionary time.
So an organism could, for example, learn not to eat some fruit because he knew wrong and sick the last time she ate it.
That could happen during the life of an organism because they had built these information processing structures that by evolution would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by death of individuals who ate that fruit fruit.
So the fact that the nervous system built those information structures enormously to accelerated the evolutionary process.
Because evolution may now happen confined to an individual.
It could happen in the time we need to learn.
But then, of course, individuals discovered the trick.
So for example, the most <unk> version we know is human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea.
I'm here sitting emitting some <unk> and hopefully building a similar idea, <unk> and <unk> in your heads that kept some analogy with mine.
But we take something very complicated we built it into sound, in sound, and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That now allows us to start as a organism.
In fact, as humanity, we've begun to perform <unk>
We now went through similar periods to the <unk> organisms -- our data and <unk> methods and information processing.
For example, the invention of language was a small step in that direction.
The <unk> computer -- the video tape, <unk> and so on, are the specialized mechanisms that we now built to handle that information.
And that brings us together in something much larger, faster and capable of evolving more than we did before.
Now evolution can happen in microseconds.
You know, you saw the evolutionary <unk> of <unk> where some evolution has been able to show up to our eyes.
And now we've accelerated time again.
The first stages of the story that I told you took a billion years each.
The next stages, the nervous system and the brain, took a few hundred million years old.
The next ones, the language, etc., they took less than a million years.
And next, as electronics, it seems to take only a few decades.
The process <unk> I guess <unk> is the right word to name something that does its own pace of change.
The more it changes, the faster you do.
And I think that's what we see in this explosion of the curve.
We see the process <unk>
But I do a living.
But now design objects of such complexity, which would be impossible for me in conventional mode.
I don't know that every transistor on that machine of connections.
There are billions.
Instead, with the designers of <unk> <unk> we think of a level of abstraction, we put it on the machine and the machine with that does something that you couldn't do before, it gets much further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes use methods that we don't even understand well.
A particularly interesting method I've been using is evolution itself.
And we put into the machine an evolutionary process that operates on the scale of every microseconds.
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
We say, "Please computer, you can run a hundred million sequences of instructions to chance?
You could run these sequences of instructions at random, running all those programs, and take those more things that are <unk> to what we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say I want to tidy numbers, to put a simple example.
So we found the programs that are closer to setting up numbers.
Of course, it's unlikely that a few random sequences of instructions, so none of them got it.
But one, luckily, he could find two numbers in the right order.
And I said, <unk> could you take 10 percent of those random sequences that best did the <unk>
And we put those and go to the rest.
And now we <unk> the <unk> the numbers.
And let's go back to <unk> following a process of <unk> analog to <unk>
Let's take two programs, which <unk> children, who <unk> <unk> and the children are going to take the properties of both of the two programs.
So we got a new generation of programs that are product of programs that had a little more successful.
And we say, "Please, repeat the <unk>
It goes again.
And we had some mutations in it.
And it tries to get another generation and try to interact with another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can make the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes or complex cases in a few hours.
In the end, we ended up with programs that are trying to be absolutely perfect.
In fact, they're very much more efficient programs than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't tell you how they work.
I've tried to analyze them to see how they work.
These are dark programs, strangers.
But do the <unk>
In fact, I know, I have the security that they get the goal because they come from a lineage of hundreds of thousands of programs that they did too.
In fact, their lives depend on it.
Once he was on a 747 with <unk> <unk> and he gets up a card and says, "Look at this.
He says, "You know, plane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> who work together to provide a <unk> flight, doesn't make you feel <unk>
We know that engineering processes don't work very well when they become complicated.
So we started to depend on computers to make different design processes.
And that allows us to produce much more complex things than produces normal engineering.
Yet we don't understand the choices that we are.
It is in front of us.
Now we use those programs to make computers much faster and so we can run these programs much more quickly.
I mean, it's <unk>
The thing goes faster and so on, I think it seems so <unk>
Because all of these technologies are <unk>
We are <unk>
And we're at a moment analog to the <unk> organisms when they became <unk>
We are <unk> and we can't understand what the hell we're creating.
We're at the turning point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant to think that we are the final product of evolution.
And I think we all are part of the creation of whatever it is to come.
But now it comes lunch and I think I'll stop here before I got stuck.
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that has to change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've spent enough time to let me give up a part of my false <unk>
Before I treat my talk, I talk to a little bit of baseball.
Why not?
We're close to the end, the World <unk>
We love baseball, right?
baseball is filled with amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's because of the <unk> <unk> talks about the statistics and use them to form a great baseball.
I'm going to focus on one of them and I hope many of you know.
It's called the average <unk>
And we're talking about 300, about 300 <unk>
That means that the bat <unk> would be three of 10 times.
That means throwing the ball into the game of play without being <unk> and that anyone who is from <unk> to the first base -- not come to time, and the second base will be <unk>
Three <unk>
You know how they call a <unk> <unk>
Well, really well, maybe the team of stars.
You know how they call a baseball <unk>
By the way, that's somebody than 10 strokes, get four.
<unk> like legendary Ted Williams, the last player in the League of <unk> Mayor of <unk> in a regular regular season.
Now I'm going to take this to my world of medicine where I feel much more comfortable or perhaps less uncomfortable, after what I'm going to tell you today.
Suppose you have <unk> and they come to a surgeon who has also a record of 400 in <unk>
It doesn't work, right?
Now suppose that you live in a place out there, and a dear self has two arteries <unk> <unk> and his family doctor derived from a cardiologist whose record record is 200 <unk>
But do you know anything?
She's getting a huge <unk> this year.
And their hits have been <unk>
This is not working.
But I'll ask you to ask you.
What do you think to be the average of the hits of a heart surgeon, or a nurse or a nurse <unk>
1,000, very well.
And the truth of the issue is that no one in the whole medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon, of a doctor or <unk>
What we do, however, is sending them to the world, and I included, with the mandate to be perfect.
I'd never, ever make a mistake and try to figure out how to do it right.
That was the message that I was talking about, when I was in medical school.
I was a Palestinian obsessional student.
Once, a fellow in high school said that Brian Goldman <unk> was a <unk> test.
Just like that.
<unk> in my little <unk> in the nurses of nurses at General <unk> not far from here.
And I learned all of memory.
From my kind of anatomy, I <unk> the origin and the <unk> the fork in every artery that comes out of the <unk> diagnostic and frequent diagnosis and the usual.
And I even knew the differential diagnosis about how to classify <unk> <unk> <unk>
And as much more and more knowledge.
And I was very good. I graduated with <unk>
And <unk> from the medical school with the impression that if you did everything, then you would know everything -- or the most possible thing, I close to everything, because I get rid of the mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met Mrs. <unk>
I was a resident in a college hospital here, in Toronto, when they brought to the emergency lady in the emergency room where I worked at.
I was assigned to the service of <unk>
And when I was able to go through a cardiologist to take a cardiologist back to that patient.
and reporting to the chief of residents.
When I saw <unk> lady was <unk>
I heard a <unk> sound.
And when the <unk> I heard a <unk> sound, both sides, which sent me a <unk> heart failure.
In these conditions the heart stops working and instead of pump the blood forward, the blood goes into our lungs, these <unk> of blood, and that's why there's difficulty breathing.
And it wasn't difficult to <unk>
I did it, and I got to work on the treatment that I was given.
I gave him <unk> and medication to ease the pressure on his heart.
He gave him <unk> water pills so that I could eliminate liquid.
And in an hour or two, she started feeling better.
And I felt great.
And that's when I made the first <unk> he sent him home.
Actually, I made two more mistakes.
He sent her home without talking to the chief of residents.
I didn't put up the phone and I didn't do what I should have done, that I was calling my boss and <unk> with him for the <unk>
And if my boss had seen it, I would have been able to bring <unk> information.
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a <unk> a constant attention.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and able to take <unk> that could take care of my patients without even contact my boss.
The second mistake I made was worse.
And he sent it to his house, he didn't pay attention to a voice in my inner where he said, <unk> is not a good idea. Not <unk>
In fact, he was so unsure that I even asked the nurse to <unk> the Mrs. "Do you think it's OK if he goes to his <unk>
And the nurse thought of it, and then he said, "Yeah, I think I'll be right."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
So he signed up the top, and the ambulance next to the ambulance with her took her home.
And I went back to the hospital.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a bad <unk> in the stomach, <unk>
But I followed my job.
At the end of the day, he <unk> to leave the hospital and walked into the parking lot where my car was to go home. And I did something I don't normally do normally, I did something that I don't do.
It went through the emergency emergency room home.
And there was another nurse, not the <unk> of the lady <unk> before, but another <unk> said to me three words, those three words that most doctors who are <unk>
Other specialists are afraid of it, but there is a <unk> in <unk> and is that we see the patients in <unk>
The three words are: does you?
Does the patient remember his <unk>
I asked the other nurse <unk>
And they said, "Well, she <unk> with the same tone of voice.
She was fine.
But I went back and on the edge of death.
In an hour of having come to his house, after I gave him the tall, he suffered a collapse and his family called the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> brought it to room with a <unk> blood pressure -- which means a shock <unk>
I was just just breathing and I was blue.
The emergency staff will raise all its resources.
They gave up medication to raise blood pressure.
And they put a <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the core.
He had a mixture of feelings because after the <unk> was in intensive care and hoped against all of the hope that they were <unk>
And in the two or three days it was obvious that they never <unk>
It had permanent damage.
The family got together.
And in eight or nine days, it was <unk> to what was happening.
And the ninth day, they let him go. <unk> wife, mother and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names that they die.
That was my first experience.
And the next few weeks, I was excited about it and experienced the <unk> of shame that exists in our medical culture, and I felt single, <unk> <unk> without feeling that healthy shame because you can't <unk> with your colleagues.
You make peace and you never make that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves a teaching.
The embarrassment of which I talk about is the one that makes us feel very bad inside.
It's the one that tells us not that we did was wrong, but we're bad guys.
And that made it.
And it wasn't for my <unk> he was a <unk>
I talked to the family and I'm sure I would take the stuff and made sure that I didn't get stuck.
And I kept getting those questions.
Why did I not ask my <unk> Why did he sent her home?
And in my worst <unk> why I made a mistake so <unk>
Why chose medicine?
Little on that feeling was <unk>
And I started to feel better.
And on a day <unk> he opened the sky and finally came out the sun, and I wondered if I would feel better again.
And I made a deal with myself in which if I was going to ask the efforts to be perfect for not to make any more mistakes, I would do any of those voices.
And he did.
I went back to work.
But it came back to happen.
Two years later, I was an artist in the emergency department in a community hospital in northern Toronto, and I got a man from 25 years with a pain in <unk>
I was very busy and <unk>
And he pointed out here.
I looked into his throat, was a little bit <unk>
He sent him away penicillin and sent him home.
But while he ran to the door was still pointing out his <unk>
Two days later, when I came to do my guard, my boss asked to talk to me <unk> in his office.
And I gave the three words: Does you?
Do you remember the patient he saw by a pain in <unk>
Well he went back and didn't have a <unk>
He had a potentially fatal condition.
You can search for Google. It's an infection, not the throat, but the top, and it can cause the close of those tracks.
He fortunately, he didn't die.
It gets antibiotics by <unk> antibiotics and recovered to the few days.
And I went through the same period of shame and <unk> then I went back and went back to work, until one and again, and again.
Two times in the same turn of the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And it's a great effort, especially working in a hospital, because it was going to be 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home, and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought I had a calculus <unk>
It was an X-ray X-ray -- but it turned out to be normal -- a colleague who was checking up the patient who was looking at a certain sensitivity in the lower right quadrant, and called the surgeon.
The other patient was very much with diarrhea.
He made her liquid order to <unk> and I asked my colleague that I was doing it.
I went through it, and he noticed some sensitivity in the lower law, called the surgeon.
Both of them were operated -- and they recovered too.
But every case I was <unk> I was <unk>
But I'd like to tell you I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise, and as many colleagues say, it's a <unk>
The most significant people have been over the last five years.
<unk> embarrassed and <unk>
And here's the problem: if I can't afford and talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the <unk> that tells me what really happens, how can I share this with my <unk>
How do I show you this so that they weren't going to make the same <unk>
If I would go into a place like this, I would have no idea what you think about me.
When was the last time you heard somebody talking about failure, after failure, after failure?
Of course you will hear about the mistakes of other doctors, but you're going to hear somebody talking about your own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues also, a <unk> in my hospital would take the wrong leg, believe it would have difficulty looking at your eyes.
This is the system that we have.
The total denial of mistakes.
It's the system that there are two <unk> the ones that make mistakes, and the ones that don't sleep and the ones that I know -- those who have <unk> results and those who have great outcomes.
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction that they start to attack that person.
We have the idea that if you move from medicine to the people who make mistakes, we will get a safe system.
But that brings two problems.
In 20 years of <unk> and medical journalism -- I've done a bad term of poor medical litigation and medical failures to learn how possible, from the first article that I wrote for Toronto Wars to my <unk> <unk> Black <unk> Black <unk>
And what I learned is that mistakes are <unk>
We worked in a system where the errors are happening every day, where one in 10 drugs will invest in the hospital are wrong, or <unk> is not correct. In a system where respiratory infections, are increasingly and more <unk> causing chaos and death.
In this country, they die <unk> by <unk> medical errors.
The U.S. Medicine was established 100,000.
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we're not <unk> the problem as we should.
And so there's things.
A <unk> system where the knowledge goes up every two or three years, and we don't have any <unk>
sleep deprivation.
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow you to make a perfect history of a patient with pain on your chest.
Now, let's take the same patient with a chest pain -- it comes up with <unk> eyes, and I find it very <unk> and all of a sudden, my story is <unk> from contempt.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do things as well.
And my patients are not cars. They don't <unk> their symptoms always in the same way.
So the mistakes are inevitable.
So if we take the system like we were <unk> and we eliminate all the professionals who are likely to mistake, well, you won't get anybody.
And with respect to that people don't want to talk about their wildest ones.
In my <unk> <unk> white, art. art.
And their students get rid of <unk> to go down and go down and go down and start to tell their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
<unk> can say, "Look, they didn't make the same <unk>
They need a context to be able to do it.
They need a medical culture.
And it starts with a physician every time.
The curator <unk> is human, you know human, they accept it, and they're not proud of their mistakes, but it is trying to learn what happened to teach others.
They put their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
We would give the mistakes of other people not with intent -- but in a loving way of <unk> and support for everybody to be <unk>
And he works in a medical culture that recognizes that humans run the system, and when this happens, they make mistakes in time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a <unk>
I'm a human, we would make mistakes.
And I feel so much, but I feel a lot of effort to be able to convey to others.
I don't know what you think about me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three words: I remember it.
Do you know how many decisions we take a day <unk>
Do you know how much we choose in a week?
Recently, I made a survey over 2,000 people and the average amount of choices that he says to pick up an American American, it's about 70 to day.
Not a lot ago, in a research on a week to a group of Catholic presidents companies.
The researchers recorded the different tasks of these executives in these executives and the time that we were trying to make decisions related to those tasks.
They found that on average, <unk> <unk> jobs a week.
Naturally, every job included a lot of <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Only 12 percent required an hour or more of your time.
Now think of your elections.
Do you know how many of you belong to the category of nine minutes, and how many of an hour?
How do you grade how to deal with those decisions?
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of the <unk> choice for the <unk> of options.
I want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions.
As I talk about this I'm going to ask you a few questions, and I need to know your answers.
When I do a question, like I'm blind, raise your hand just if you want to burn calories.
Otherwise, when you ask a question, if your answer is positive for please give you a <unk>
And now my first question on the day, are ready to hear about the problem of <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
Being a graduate student at the University of Stanford, <unk> this <unk> <unk> at least in that time was very sophisticated at least at the time.
It was called <unk>
It was almost like going to a <unk> park.
There was like 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> over 500 different types of fruits and vegetables and about 25 water <unk> and this was when we had water from the tap.
I loved going to that grocery store, but I was going, why I never buy nothing?
This is the shelf oil shelf there.
They had more than 75 different classes, including the ones that were in <unk> box, which came from trees.
Once I decided to go to the manager and asked her, <unk> this strategy for offering all these <unk>
He pointed to me the buses full of tourists that came every day, usually with their cameras.
We decided to do a little experiment with the <unk> This is the <unk>
<unk>
They had different kinds of different classes.
They took a post to <unk> right at the tent.
We put in <unk> <unk> or 24 different flavors and we looked at two things: First, where people were willing to stop testing the <unk>
More people stopped when I had <unk> a '60s, when there was only six, 40 percent.
We also look at what case they were more likely to buy a jar of <unk>
Here we find the opposite effect.
If he stopped when there were only three percent just got to buy <unk>
From the ones that stood up when there was six, we saw 30 percent.
If we do the calculations, the people had six times more likely to buy <unk> if they were six, that if they were in 24.
Well, decide that we don't buy <unk> we probably want to give us any less -- it's a good thing to keep <unk> but it turns out that the problem of <unk> choices are affecting us in real decisions.
We decided not to decide, even though this doesn't <unk>
Now the theme of the day, saving financial savings.
I'm going to tell you a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we look at decisions about savings for about a million Americans, from about 650 plans in between 650 plans in the country.
We were interested in seeing if the number of money funds available for savings plans.
And we found that I actually had a <unk>
We had <unk> plans for two to 59 options.
We found that the bigger the hedge fund number had less participation.
So if we look at the extreme, we see that in the plans that provide two funds, the rate of participation was 70 or more, not as high as they want.
And in the plans to offer about 60 funds, the rate of participation came to the <unk>
It turns out that even if you decide to participate, when there is more choices, even in that case, there's unintended consequences.
So for those who decided to participate, the bigger it was the number of choices, more people being allowed to avoid actions or hedge funds.
The more you would have more choices, they were more willing to invest in financial bank accounts.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we need to optimize to optimize the future financial well-being.
In the previous decade we've seen three major negative consequences by offering more and more possibilities.
The most likely thing is that you make the decision that <unk> even when this is going to be against self-interest.
It's more likely to take the worst decisions in finance, in health.
They're more likely to pick things less <unk> even though objectively it will be better.
The main reason is that we're going to look at that giant array of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations so that we can contrast and choose that amazing <unk>
I want to give you a lot of simple techniques that we have done in one way or another, in different research, so that they can test in their businesses.
The first is, <unk>
You've never heard before, but it's never been more true than today, which is less than today, which is less than today.
People always laugh when I say, <unk>
Are you concerned about losing space in the <unk>
But what we're seeing is what we're seeing more and more is that if you choose to cut, to get rid of strange choices, there will be an increase in sales, <unk> the costs, there will be a better experience in choice.
When <unk> & <unk> went from 26 different types of <unk> & <unk> at 15, saw 10 percent increase in sales.
When the Golden Golden <unk> eliminated the products for loss of cats that fewer <unk> was increased <unk> by two <unk> greater sales and less costs.
You know that the supermarkets on average, offer 45,000 products.
In a Wal-Mart store there is about 100,000 products.
But the ninth largest store in the world today is <unk> and it offers only 1,400 <unk> a kind of tomato sauce in tin.
In the financial savings, I think one of the best examples that have arisen on how to drive better choices is the <unk> of David <unk> the Harvard program.
All employees at Harvard are <unk> automatically to a certain of life.
Those of you who really want to choose, they give them 20 or not 300 or more.
They already know that people often say, "I don't know as <unk>
They're all <unk> choices.
The first thing I do is ask the <unk> <unk> the differences that are among those options.
And if your employees can't afford it, you can't do their <unk>
This afternoon, before I started this session, I was talking to <unk>
He told me that he would be willing to offer people in this audience a few holidays to the most beautiful road in the world.
Here, a <unk>
I want you to read it.
I'm going to leave a few seconds to <unk> and then I want you to give you a little round of applause.
<unk> <unk> Okay. Anybody who is ready to accept the supply.
They're not more?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a trick.
Who is ready for that <unk>
I think I actually got to hear more hands.
All right.
Actually, you had more information on the first round of it, that in the second one, but I can tell you that they thought that the second time was more real.
Because the images made it look more real.
This leads me to the second technique to handle the problem of <unk> <unk>
For people understand the differences between choices, they have to understand the consequences of each option, and that the consequences must feel very <unk>
Why do people spend 15 to 30 percent more on average, when you use debit cards or credit card than when they use <unk>
Because it doesn't look like real money.
It turns out to make it look more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to do more.
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> staff who were working in <unk> these people were in a meeting where they were <unk> to a <unk> plan.
And that meeting, that meeting exactly as we were <unk> we made a little <unk>
What we added was that I was telling the staff that you would think of the positive things that we would have in their lives if they were saving more money.
With this <unk> there was an increase in the <unk> of 20 percent and an increase in the amount they were interested in saving or what they wanted to put in their <unk> accounts of <unk>
The third technique is <unk>
We can handle more categories than options.
For example, this is a study that we did in a magazine aisle
We saw that in supermarkets, <unk> across the corridor of the magazine -- the magazines can contain from <unk> different kinds of way to <unk>
But, you know?
Because <unk> tells me how to <unk>
These are two exhibitions of <unk>
One is called <unk> and the other, <unk>
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> Well, there's a few.
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> But you know what?
This framework is completely useless.
<unk> must tell you something to you that they are not going to be <unk>
And you often see this problem with these huge fundraising.
I'm supposed to be <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
It turns out that we can handle a lot more information than what we think about, if you just <unk> it a little bit.
We need to increase complexity gradually.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's see a good decision, the purchase of a car.
This is a German manufacturer of cars that lets <unk> completely.
You have to make 60 decisions, and put the car.
And these decisions vary in the number of choices that offers each one.
I have 56 possibilities.
<unk> <unk> four options.
What I'm going to do is change the order that the decisions.
So half of the customers are going to go from many choices, 56 colors, to just like four <unk>
The other half of customers are going to go from a few options, four <unk> at 56 colors, many options.
And what am I going to do about it?
How do you think you are.
If you were <unk> always the default button in each decision, this indicates that they're <unk> or <unk> we're <unk>
We found that the ones that go from many choices to few days, <unk> the <unk> button and again, and another one.
The <unk>
If you go from a few options to many, they continue there.
The same information, the same number of options.
The only thing I did was disrupt the order that you presented with information.
If we start with the easy, you learn to <unk>
Even though you pick the box of change doesn't say nothing about the preferences of post-traumatic decoration.
We are excited about a product that we're building that now has more <unk> with the process.
To sum up.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> we can handle more categories less than <unk> <unk> complexity.
All these techniques that I've presented them were designed to help drive the <unk> or better, for you, to use them in their issues, or for people who are going to work.
It's that I think the key to getting the best of a choice is to be careful to <unk>
And the more careful how we are in our choices better we can practice the art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the 1920s, in East Germany, <unk> if you had a typewriter that was written to the government.
You had to register a sheet of text written with the machine.
And so the government could track the origin of the texts.
If they found a writing with the wrong message, you could trace the footprint up to the origin of the idea.
In the West we don't think that somebody could do this, how much this will be -- the freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser printer from any big manufacturer and print a page, that page will end up having a few yellow printed dots on each page that follow a pattern that makes them own and your printer.
That's happening today.
And no one seems to be <unk> a lot of it.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us, the citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems in the network.
If we look at what happens in the online world, we can put up the attacks on their <unk>
There are three main groups.
Are you <unk>
Like Mr. <unk> <unk> in Ukraine.
<unk> mobile phone is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use the cyberattacks to earn a lot of money, large amounts.
There are really many cases of <unk> online, <unk> that you would use money with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthew Anderson, <unk> <unk> etc., etc.
These guys make their online <unk> but they do it by illegal means by illegal <unk> to steal money from our accounts when we buy in <unk> or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we buy a computer <unk>
The secret American service, two months ago, <unk> the Swiss account of this sir, Sam <unk> and this account had <unk> million dollars when it was frozen frozen.
Mr. <unk> <unk> <unk> don't know your <unk>
And I say that today is more likely than any of us be a victim of a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is wrong on the worst.
In the future, most crimes online crimes online.
The second group of <unk> in importance today is not driven by money.
There's another thing that moves, they motivate them the protests, they motivate them, they motivate them laughter.
So groups like Anonymous -- they have <unk> in the last 12 months occupying a major role in online attacks.
Those are the three <unk> <unk> criminals who do for money, <unk> such as Anonymous who do to protest and the last group are the United States and the governments that <unk>
And then we see cases like <unk>
That's a good example of government attack against their own citizens.
<unk> is an authority of <unk> the Netherlands or it actually was.
<unk> <unk> last fall because of a <unk>
I took the safety of the site and carried out a <unk>
Last week, I asked, in a meeting with the Dutch government representatives I asked one of the leaders if you were to <unk> <unk> the death of people who are due to <unk>
And the answer of it was yes.
So how do people die of an attack of these?
<unk> is an authority <unk>
<unk> <unk>
Why do we make the <unk>
Well, you need if you have a website with <unk> services, services like <unk>
Except for you to get a foreign authority out of foreign authority.
And that they <unk> <unk>
And in the case of <unk> it happened, exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt, the Mexican protesters the headquarters for the Egyptian secret police in April, 2011, and during the <unk> of the building, they found a lot of papers.
Among those papers was this folder called <unk>
And within that folder there were notes from a company based on Germany that had sold the Egyptian government, to intercept a large scale on the communications of the citizens of the country.
They had sold this tool for 3,000 euros to the government <unk>
The headquarters for the company is right here.
I mean, Western governments provide tools for governments to make it to their citizens.
But Western governments also do this for themselves.
For example, in Germany, just a couple of weeks ago, I found the <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by government officials to investigate their own citizens.
If you're suspicious in a criminal case, well, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But today, it goes further.
It <unk> the Internet connection.
We would have even tools like <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all of communication, and listen to the online discussions and get our data.
When we think closely on things like these the obvious answer should be "Well, it seems bad, but it doesn't really affect me because I'm an honest citizen.
Why <unk>
I have nothing to do it.
And that argument doesn't make sense.
It's in play privacy.
Privacy is not <unk>
It's not a question of privacy against safety.
It's about freedom against control.
If we well could be confident in our governments today in 2011, any right right now that we're going to spend today, will be forever.
<unk> to any future government, in a administration that we could have in 50 years?
These are the questions that you have to worry about in the next 50 years.
This is where I live in Kenya, in the southern part of Yellowstone National Park.
These are the cows of my dad, in the background, and behind the cows, the National Park.
The Yellowstone National Park has no fences in most of the South, which means that wild animals like <unk> migrate freely out of the park.
And predators, like the lions, they follow it, and this is what they do.
<unk> our cattle.
This is one that they killed at night, and so soon we wake up in the morning and we found it dead -- I felt very bad because it was the only bull that we had.
My community, the <unk> we think we came from the sky with our animals and all the land to <unk> and so we value it so much.
So I grew up with a lot of lions.
People are dying in the warriors who protect our community and cattle, and also mad at the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of the six lions that killed in Nairobi.
I think this is so few in the National Park.
A boy in my community, at six to nine years is responsible for the cattle.
So I had to find a way to solve this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought the lions would tell them fear.
But I realized that this is actually not <unk> because it was even helping lions see the pen away.
I didn't have <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
He was trying to trick the lions to believe that he was close to <unk>
But lions are very intelligent.  They came up the first day, and they saw the <unk> and they were, but the second day, and they went back and said, this thing isn't moving, is always here.  So I jumped and killed animals.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and that day lions didn't come.
I found that lions are afraid of the light that moves.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch that you can turn on and turn the lights.
And this is a little lamp of a <unk> <unk>
<unk> everything.
As you can see, the solar panel load the battery and battery it, the electricity to the little box <unk> I call it a transformative.
And the box <unk> makes the lights <unk>
As you can see, the <unk> get outside, because that's where the lions.
And this is how you see lions when they come out of night.
<unk> lights and <unk> lions to think that I'm walking through the <unk> but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my house two years ago, and since then, we never got a problem with lions.
And the homes of the neighborhood heard the idea.
One of them is from this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of animals and asked me if I could put the lights.
I said yes.
You can see them, you can see the background, these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've installed them in seven houses in my community, and they're serving a lot.
And my idea is also used for all of Kenya, to frightening to other predators as entrance, <unk> and it's also being used to take elephants from the farms.
So thanks to this invention, I was fortunate enough to get a scholarship to one of the best schools in Kenya, Medical School, and I'm very excited.
My new school now is helping raise funds and <unk>
It even took my friends to my community, and we installed lights in the houses that they don't have, and I show them how to <unk> them.
So a year ago, I was just a kid in the meadows of the <unk> <unk> the cows of my father, and he used to see airplanes to fly, and told me that one day would be inside one.
And here I am.
I got the opportunity to come to TED.
My big dream is to get to be an engineer of aviation and a pilot when you grow up.
I used to hate the lions, but now as my invention is saving the cows of my dad and the lions, we can be with lions without any conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my tongue means thank you.
Chris Anderson: You don't picture how exciting it is to listen to a story like you.
So you got a <unk> Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: You're working on other electrical inventions for us.
What's the next one in your list?
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to make an electric fence close to it.
<unk> I know that the fences were invented <unk> but I want to do mine.
CA: So I would take it once, right?
We are going to get it in every single step that we have <unk> my friend.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you.
When I was a little girl, I thought my country was the best on the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called "No <unk>
And I felt very proud.
In school, we would spend all the time studying the story of Kim <unk> but we never learned much about the rest of the world, except that America, South Korea is the enemies.
Though I was wondering about the rest of the world, I thought I would spend my whole life in North Korea, until everything changed a whole lot changed.
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public run.
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family wasn't poor and I was never hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my sister.
That said, "When we <unk> this, the five members of the family will stop there in this world, because we haven't eaten in the two weeks past now.
We're putting together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak, we're ready to die."
He was very altered.
It was the first time I heard that people were suffering in my country.
At the time, when I walked in front of the train station, I saw something terrible that I can't erase my memory.
One woman without life was dead on the street, holding a child in his arms looking at her face of his mother without being able to do anything.
No one <unk> because they were very concerned about taking care of them and their families.
A tremendous famine went down to North Korea in the <unk>
In the end, over a million North Koreans died during famine and only a few survived eating grass, <unk>
They also made more and more frequently energy power, everything around us was completely dark on the night except for the lights in the sea in China, barely crossing the river from my home.
I always wondered why they had light and we don't.
This is a satellite picture of North Korea in the night compared to the neighboring countries.
This is the river <unk> which serves between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain points, allowing North Koreans to <unk>
But many people die.
Sometimes, I saw bodies floating around in the river.
I can't reveal the details of how I walked out of North Korea, but I can only say that over the years of famine was sent to China to live with relatives <unk>
But I just thought that would be separate from my family for short time.
I could never have imagined that I would take 14 years back to live together.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea how life would be as an refugee refugee
But soon I learned that it's not just extremely difficult, but dangerous, because the North refugees in China were considered illegal <unk>
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to a horrible fate back in North Korea.
One day, my worst nightmare was done, when I was arrested by the Chinese police, and I was <unk> in the police station.
Somebody had accused me for being <unk> then <unk> my skills in the Chinese language, and I got a lot of questions.
I was <unk>
I thought my heart was going to exploit.
If it didn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to wrap up.
But I managed to control my emotions and answered the questions.
At the end of the <unk> an officer told another, "This was a fake report.
And let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans in China are searching for asylum <unk>
But many people can be arrested by the Chinese police, and <unk>
These women were very lucky.
Although there were <unk> they were eventually released after a harsh international pressure.
These Koreans were not so lucky.
Every year, countless North Koreans are captured in China and <unk> North Korea, where they're <unk> incarcerated or executed in public.
Though I was lucky to escape many other North Koreans have not been so lucky.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identities and fight so hard to survive.
Even after learning a new language and finding work, all the world can be able to do it in a second.
That's why after 10 years to hide my identity, I decided to get a risk going to South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
<unk> in South Korea was a much greater challenge than I had expected.
English was very important in Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
Also, I understood that there was a big gap between North and South.
We're all <unk> but inside, we've come to be very different because of 67 years of <unk>
It even went through an identity.
I'm <unk> or <unk>
Where am I I? Who am I?
Suddenly, there was no country that I could call my pride in my life.
Even though I went to life in South Korea was not easy, I made a plan. I started studying for the exam to college.
Just when I was starting to <unk> my new life, I got an alarming call.
The North Korean authorities had some money that sent to my family, and, as blame, my family was going to be moved to the force to a remote location in the <unk>
They had to flee immediately.
So I started planning how to help them escape.
North Koreans have to travel long distances on the way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea.
So, ironically, I took a flight to China and went to the border with North Korea.
Because my family could not speak Chinese, I had to get them in some way, for over 3,000 miles through China and then through Southeast Asia.
The journey in <unk> took one week, and we were almost caught several times.
One time, our bus was arrested and addressed by an Indian police officer.
He asked all of us, and he started asking them questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be arrested.
When the Chinese officer came up to my family, <unk> I stood up and I said that they were <unk> people who were <unk>
I looked at me <unk> but fortunately I believed me.
We made the whole way up to the border of <unk>
But I had to spend almost all my money to bribe the guards in <unk>
But even after switching the border, my family was arrested and imprisoned by crossing the border <unk>
After paying <unk> and bribes, my family was liberated in a month.
But in time, my family was arrested and incarcerated over again in the capital of <unk>
This was one of the lowest points in my life.
I did everything to liberate my family, and we were so close to me, but my family was <unk> in prison to short of the embassy of South Korea.
I went out and between the immigration office and the police station, desperately trying to liberate my family.
But it didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
At that time, or the voice of a man said, "What's the problem?"
I was so amazed that a stranger would mind asking.
With my poor English and a dictionary I explained to him the situation, and without <unk> the man went to the <unk> and he gave me the rest of the money for my family and for another two North Koreans and landing them.
I went through my heart, and I said, "Why am I <unk>
"I'm not telling you, he said.
"I am helping the village <unk>
I realized that that was a symbolic moment in my life.
<unk> kind of <unk> a new hope for me and for the village to be <unk> when you get it more <unk>
And I showed me that the kindness of strangers and support of the international community are really the probability of hope that the people who are <unk> needs.
Over time, after our long journey, my family and I met in South Korea.
But their freedom is only half the battle.
Many North Koreans are separated.
So we can benefit from the international community with education, practical language practices, and more.
We can also act as a bridge between people in North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because many of us continue to contact with family contact, we send information and we send money and money that is helping to change North Korea from within.
I've been very <unk> I've gotten a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help North Koreans an opportunity to thrive with international support.
And I'm sure you're going to see more and more North Koreans <unk> around the world, including at TED.
Thank you.
I live in South Korea.
This is <unk> <unk> stores of fast food <unk> <unk>
So the city planners come together, and they thought, we're going to change the name of South Center so that it represents something else, so they changed it to Los Angeles, and as if this is <unk> what's actually wrong in the city.
This is Los Angeles in the South Angeles --  <unk> <unk> food <unk>
Just like <unk> millions of other Americans, I live in a food desert, L.A. Center home from the food sites to take and eat in the car.
The funny thing is that the places of food to get people killing more people than food in the car.
People are dying of diseases that are dying in Los Center.
For example, the rate of obesity in my neighborhood is five times older than say, <unk> <unk> which is about 15 miles away.
I think that this will happen.
And I ask myself, how would you feel if you didn't have access to healthy food, and if every time they come out of home you see the effects <unk> that the current food system has in its <unk>
I see lawn chairs and sold as a car <unk>
I see <unk> centers like <unk>
And I think this must stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
The food is the problem, and it's the solution.
And I also got tired of how to drive 45 minutes back and go back to buy an apple that doesn't have pesticides.
What I did, was plant a food forest in front of my house.
In a strip of land we call a <unk>
It's about 45 meters x 3 me.
The point is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to keep it going.
I said, "Well, I can do the thing that comes to me, because it's my responsibility and I have to <unk>
That's how I decided to keep it going.
So my group and I, Green <unk> got us together and we started to plant our food forest -- <unk> trees -- you know, the nine different <unk>
What we do, we are kind of a group of paid paid per way ahead of the gardeners of all the <unk> of all the city and completely volunteer, and everything we do is free.
And the garden, was beautiful.
Then somebody gets <unk>
The city came to me, and in <unk> I was given a <unk> saying that I had to take my garden, the <unk> became <unk>
And I said, "Come on, right?
A criminal order for planting food in a piece of land that nobody <unk>  And so I was like, "Okay, let's go away."
Because this time it wasn't going to happen.
L.A. Times had written written by Steve <unk> and talked to the <unk> and one of the members of Green <unk> who put a request in <unk> with 900 <unk> <unk> was a success.
We had the victory in our hands.
My <unk> even called to say that <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, we go, why not?
L.A. is the U.S. city with more <unk>
It's got 68 miles of <unk>
That's 20 Central <unk>
That's enough space to plant <unk> millions of vegetable plants.
Why on Earth don't you look at it?
<unk> a plant -- 10 thousand seeds.
When a dollar of <unk> I'll give you 75 dollars of a result.
It's my <unk> when I tell people, you cultivate your own food.
You get your own food is like print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for South Pole.
I grew up there, <unk> my kids there.
And I was pleased to be part of this <unk> reality, which was <unk> for me, and I'm going to manufacture my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I grow my art.
Such a <unk> artist who <unk> walls, I <unk> soils, <unk>
I use the garden, the land, like a piece of canvas, and plants and trees, are my <unk> of that canvas.
They were <unk> to see what the earth can do, if they leave her canvas.
You simply can't imagine how amazing it is a <unk> and how it affects people.
What happened?
I'm a witness to how my garden turned into a tool of education, in transformation of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the ground.
We are the ground.
It was <unk> to see how it affects the guys.
<unk> is the most <unk> act and thought that they can do, especially in a <unk>
Also, they get <unk>
I remember one occasion that came to a mother and her daughter, were like the <unk> of the night and were in my backyard, and they were looking very <unk>
I, well, man, I felt wrong that they were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt shame when I saw people who were so close to me hungry, and this just <unk> why I do this, people ask me, <unk> don't really hope that people will steal your <unk>
And I say, "Oh my God, I don't have to fear that you go to <unk>
That's the street.
That's what it's about.
I want the <unk> but at his time, I want you to <unk> your <unk>
There was another occasion that I put in a garden in a shelter in the center of Los Angeles.
They were these guys, which helped me download the truck.
It was great, I shared his stories about how this had been affected and how they used to plant their mom and their grandmother, and it was great to see how this changed it, so it was just a moment.
So Green <unk> has come to plant maybe 20 <unk>
We've had about 50 people who come from, work and <unk> all of them on volunteer plan.
If kids are growing up, kids will eat <unk>
If you raise the tomatoes, they'll eat <unk>  But if none of these are <unk> if you're not taught how food is affecting the mind and the body, they eat blind what they put them in front of them.
I see young people who want to work, but they have this thing in which they are caught. I see these guys in this path designed for them, which doesn't take them anywhere.
With the <unk> I see an opportunity where we can train these kids who are concerned about their communities to have a sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe the next George George <unk>
But if we don't change the composition of the land, we never will.
Now this is one of my plans, this is something I want to do.
I want to plant a whole block of gardens, where people can share food on the same block.
I want to take them back and turn them into the healthy <unk>
I didn't believe me.
I'm not talking about free, because the free is not sustainable.
What's curious about sustainability, is you have to <unk>
So what I'm talking about is to put people out of the street, getting the kids out of the street, who know the joy, the pride and the honor of growing their own food, opening markets of farmers.
What I want to do here, we have to make sexy.
I want everybody to become <unk> <unk> <unk> gardeners <unk>
We have to change the script of what's a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
Do you get them to take their <unk> OK?
That is their weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet with me, you know, if you want to see me, I wouldn't call me if you want to sit in the comfortable chairs and have meetings to talk about doing some <unk> to talk about making some shit.
If you want to see me, come into the garden with your <unk> so that we can plant something.
Peace Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>  You probably all agree with me that this is a very nice road to me.
It's made of <unk> and asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially in days as it rains a lot.
You can have a huge amount of water in the asphalt that we <unk>
And especially if you go on your bike and these cars, that's not really nice.
Moreover, the asphalt can make a lot of noise.
It's a noisy material, and if we build roads, like in the Netherlands, very close to the cities, we would want a quiet <unk>
The solution for that is to do the road with asphalt <unk>
The asphalt is a material that we use now in most parts of the Netherlands, has pores and water can pass through it, so all the water water flow on the sides and they will have a road that is easy to drive, and they will have no water anymore.
The noise also disappear into these <unk>
Because it's very open to the <unk> all the noise, so it's a very silent <unk>
It also has <unk> of course, and the disadvantage on this road is that you can <unk>
What is <unk> You see that on this road -- the rocks of the surface of the surface is out of the surface of the surface of the surface of the surface of the surface of the surface of the surface of the surface of the surface of the surface of the surface of the surface of the surface of the surface of the surface of the surface of the
First of a stone -- then a lot more and more and more, and so on, and <unk> -- well, I'm not going to do that.  But they can harm your <unk> and you won't be happy with that.
And finally, this can also take more and more damage.
Sometimes they can create <unk> with that.
<unk> It's ready.
<unk> of course, can be converted into a problem, but we have a solution.
So here you can really see the damage in this material.
This is a asphalt <unk> as I said, so it only has a small amount of <unk> between stones.
Because of the <unk> to the light <unk> to the <unk> this <unk> the glue between the <unk> <unk> and if they were <unk> they will be <unk> and separate from the <unk>
So if you drive the road, you get the <unk> as we saw here.
So to solve this problem, we think about <unk> materials.
If we can make this material <unk> then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is use <unk> <unk> from that to clean <unk> and we can cut out the steel <unk> in pieces of small pieces, and we can mix those little bits with the <unk>
So we have asphalt with little pieces of steel <unk>
Then you need a machine, like the one you see here, that you use to show them a <unk> machine.
<unk> can heat up, especially steel, it's very good at that.
So what you have to do is do what you have to do is heat the steel, melt away by these <unk> and the stones go back to the surface.
I used a <unk> <unk> because I can't bring the great <unk> machine here to the stage.
The microwave oven, is a similar system.
I put the sample, which now I'm going to take to see what happened.
This is the sample that comes out now.
I said we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab to heat the samples.
We tried a lot of samples there, and then the government, really saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's really interesting. We have to <unk>
So we gave us a piece of road, 400 feet of the highway <unk> where we had to do a test lane to test this material.
So that was what we did there. You see where we were doing the operating test, and then, of course, this road is going to last several years without any damage. That's what we know about practice.
We took a lot of samples from this road and test them in the lab.
We made aging the samples, we put a lot of charge on them, the numbers after our <unk> machine, and the fixed numbers, and we went back to it.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can say that we have made a material using fibers of steel, incorporating these fibers, using the energy of <unk> to actually increase the life of the surface of the road, even you can double the life of the surface -- it actually will save a lot of money with very simple tricks.
And now, of course, they have curiosity that also worked.
We still have the sample here. It's pretty hot.
Actually, you have to cool first before I can show you how it acts like it.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yes, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11, I remember having woken up one morning with the sound of the <unk> in my house.
My father was listening to him News in his little gray radius.
I had a great smile in his face that was unusual at those times, because the news is usually <unk>
"The Taliban <unk> her father.
I didn't know what to do, but I could see my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a school of <unk> he said.
One morning I will never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six years when the Taliban <unk> out of Afghanistan and they made the girls go to school.
For the next five years, I was inspired as a child to give me to my older sister that I could no longer be outside to go to a secret school.
It was the only way that the two could be <unk>
Every day, we had a different route to anybody that no one could suspect where to do it.
We had to hide books in market bags so that we were shopping.
The school was in a house, over 100 of us getting up in a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but extremely <unk> in the summer.
We all knew that <unk> our lives, the teacher, the students and our parents.
Every single time in a while, I had suddenly been a week, because the Taliban <unk>
We always wondered what they knew about.
They were <unk>
Did you know where to <unk>
We were <unk> but still, school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow in a family where education was <unk> and the daughters a <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for her time.
A total <unk> of a remote province in Afghanistan, <unk> in his daughter, my mother, my mother, out to school, and so his father would <unk>
But my mother got mastery.
This is it.
He went last two years ago, just to turn our house home for girls and women from our neighborhood.
And my father -- this is the first one of his family in getting education.
There was no doubt that his children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite the <unk> despite the risks.
For him, there was a higher risk to not educate her children.
Over the years of <unk> I remember there were moments when I was very frustrated with our life, and he was always scared and not see a future.
I wanted to quit, but my father said, <unk> daughter of me, can you lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money. Can you stop leaving your house during a war.
But there's one thing that will always be with you, what's here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we will do it.
So, you still want to be <unk>
I am 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed for decades of war.
Less than six percent of women in my age have more than the high school, and if my family hadn't been so committed to my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find myself proud to graduate in <unk> College.
When I returned to Afghanistan, my grandfather, which was <unk> from his home to educate his daughters, was one of the first ones in <unk>
He wasn't just getting rid of my college degree, but also that I was the first woman, and I'm the first woman, who I am driving through Kabul.
My family thinks about me.
I dream in big, but my family has even bigger dreams for <unk>
That's why I am the global ambassador for <unk> a global campaign to educate women.
It's because of the first one and maybe the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country in which is still risky for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is, I see the students in my school with the strong desire to harness the opportunity.
And I see their parents and their families who, like mine, <unk> for them, despite and still in front of an opposition <unk>
As a <unk> It's not his true name, and I can't show you his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Less than a month, he and his daughter were going to go from <unk> to his village, and literally he was killed by being killed by a bomb on the way, for minutes.
When he comes to her house, it's the phone, a voice had noticed that if he followed his daughter to school, they would go back to try.
<unk> already, if <unk> said, "but I'm not damaging the future of my old daughter and <unk> ideas."
What I've realized from Afghanistan, and it's something that is often forgotten in the West, is that behind most of the <unk> there is a father who recognized the value of his daughter and he sees that the success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers have not been key in our success.
In fact, they often are the first compelling <unk> of their daughters, but in the context of a society like the Western Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under <unk> the girls who went to school in <unk> remember it was illegal.
But over today, over three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan looks so different from here in the U.S.
I find that Americans see the fragility of the changes.
And we would argue that these changes don't last a lot, after the retirement U.S.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I look at the students in my school and their parents who were <unk> for them, that the <unk> I see the future <unk> and a <unk> change.
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities <unk> and every day the girls of <unk> would get me away.
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
You never, ever forgotten my grandmother's words that died in the <unk> <unk> resists <unk> against him.
But never come back with a revolutionary <unk>
It's been almost two years since that broke revolution was inspired by the <unk> of mass <unk> so much of the <unk> revolution like <unk>
A forces with many other citizens <unk> inside and outside of the country to call a day of anger and starting a revolution against the <unk> regime of <unk>
And it was a great revolution.
Women and young men were <unk> were on the <unk> <unk> the each one of the regime, are <unk> of freedom, dignity and social justice.
They've shown you a copy of the face of the <unk> <unk>
They've shown a great sense of solidarity from the <unk> East, to the west to the south.
Finally, after a period of six months of brutal war and a few losses from about 50 dead dollars, we managed to liberate our country and overthrowing the <unk>
However, <unk> left a heavy load, a legacy of <unk> corruption and <unk>
For four decades, the Tunisian regime of <unk> destroyed the infrastructure, the culture and the moral structure of the <unk> society.
<unk> from the devastation and the challenges, I've wanted, next to many other women, rebuild civil society -- <unk> a inclusive transition and fair to democracy and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national
There were about 200 organizations in <unk> <unk> and immediately after the fall of <unk> about 300 in <unk>
After a <unk> period, of <unk> I went back to Libya and with a unique enthusiasm -- I began to organize workshops about developing capacities and leadership skills.
With an amazing group of women we founded the Women's Women <unk> by <unk> a movement of women, leaders, very <unk> to advocate for the autonomy of the woman, and for our right to participate in the construction of democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the period of <unk> an environment that was getting more and more <unk> than <unk> from the selfish policies of domination and <unk>
Over time, our initiative was violent and successful.
Women won an <unk> of National Congress in the first election in 52 years.
However, recently, the exhilaration of elections and the revolution like one whole, were <unk> every day we found news from violence.
One day we woke up with the news of the <unk> of mosques in ancient <unk>
Another day <unk> with the news of the murder of the American ambassador and the attack on the <unk>
Another day we woke up with the news of the murder of the military.
And every day, every day we woke up with the government of the <unk> and their violations of human rights from prisoners and their lack of respect of the law.
Our society, made up by a single mentality of the next mentality -- more and it has gone away from the ideals and principles of freedom, dignity, social justice, we had the beginning.
<unk> <unk> and revenge became the icons of the consequences of the revolution.
I'm not here today at all to deal with our story of success success and the elections.
I am here today to say that we, as a nation, choosing badly, we make the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize good.
Because elections didn't bring peace and stability and security.
The <unk> list, and the <unk> between candidates and <unk> brought peace and reconciliation and <unk>
No, they didn't.
What happened then?
Why is our society still <unk> and dominated with selfish policies of domination, and they're both for men like women?
Maybe what was missing was not only women, but the female values of compassion, mercy and <unk>
Our society needs national dialogue.
Our nation needs the lifespan of the more of the female and the <unk> representation of it.
We need to stop acting as agents of outrage and call days from anger.
We need to start acting like compassion and mercy.
We have to develop a female speech, that not just <unk> but also to put the mercy in practice in place in terms of revenge. <unk> in place of competence, the inclusion instead of <unk>
These are the ideals that Libya, <unk> by war, desperately needs to end up to achieve peace.
Because peace has a <unk> which is about the interrelationship and <unk> between female perspectives and <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to establish that in an existential way, before we do it <unk>
According to a <unk> of the Koran <unk> <unk> "is the word of the God <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the time, the word <unk> which is known in all the <unk> traditions -- has the same root in Arabic that the word <unk> <unk> the feminine and <unk> that spans all the humanity that men and women of which all the tribes and all villages have <unk>
And so, like the uterus completely covers the <unk> that grows inside, the divine matrix of compassion <unk> all of existence.
This is how he says, "I'm going to be <unk>
This is how it tells us, "My <unk> mercy on my <unk>
That everyone is given to you the grace of mercy.
Thank you.
And I'm here today to talk to you about a psychological question, which has a equally <unk> response.
It is about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to address is the one that everybody does. Why she's left?
Why was someone going to stay with a man who <unk>
I'm not a psychiatrist, no social worker, no expert in domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story to tell.
I was 22 years old. I had just been <unk> at Harvard University.
I had moved to New York City as a writer and the editor in the journal <unk>
I had my first apartment, my first green <unk> American <unk> and he had a very big secret.
My secret was that many, many times, the man that I believed my soul <unk> <unk> my head with a <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk>
The man who loved one more than anybody in this world, put a gun on my head and <unk> with <unk> more times than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> a psychological abuse, <unk> <unk> where every year millions of women, and even some men.
It could even be your story.
I don't look like a typical survivor of domestic violence.
I'm a <unk> at Harvard University, and I have an MBA in <unk> from the Business Business <unk>
I've spent most of my career working for companies on the list of <unk> <unk> between them Johnson & Johnson, Leo <unk> and The Washington <unk>
I have almost 20 years married to my second husband and we have three children.
My dog is a black <unk> and lead a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can go to anyone, all races, all religions, all of the entire countries and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everybody thinks that domestic violence happens to women, which is a women's problem.
Not exactly.
Over 85 percent of the <unk> are men, and domestic abuse only happens in <unk> <unk> <unk> and long duration or said otherwise in families, the last place where we would want or hope to find <unk> for which, domestic abuse is so <unk>
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world that would sit with a man who sticks it, and I actually was a very typical victim for my age.
I was 22 years old, and in the United States women in between 16 and 24 years old, they have three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than the other ages, and more than 500 women and girls of that age are killed each year by partners, <unk> and husbands <unk> in the United States.
I was also a typical victim, because I knew nothing about domestic violence, their warning signals or their patterns.
I met <unk> on a cold cold <unk>
I was sitting next to my side in New York City and started <unk> with me.
He told me two things.
The first one was that he had just been <unk> from a college <unk> university and working on a very major bank of Wall Street.
But the most struck me in that first encounter was that it was ready and fun, and it seemed like a <unk>
I had some great <unk> like apples, and a <unk> hair, wheat, and it seemed so sweet.
One of the smartest things he made <unk> from the beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of a mate.
He did it especially at the beginning, in a <unk>
We started coming out and loved all of me -- that I was list, I had gone to Harvard, who put passion to help girls teenage girls, and my job.
I wanted to know everything about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
<unk> believed in me, as a writer and as a woman, as nobody had ever done before.
And it was why the degree in that <unk> school and work on Wall Street and his brilliant future had so much important for him.
I didn't know that the first phase in any domestic violence relationship is <unk> and <unk> to the victim.
And I didn't know that the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was I went from New York and leave the work of my dreams, but I thought I had to do sacrifices for your partner, so I said, I left my work and <unk> and I went out together.
I had no idea that I was falling into a <unk> <unk> who was entering the head in a physical, financial and financial and psychological psychological trap.
The next step in the pattern of domestic violence is to introduce the threat of violence to see how it reacts it.
And this is where you go into the scene of those <unk>
And as soon as we moved to New England -- you know, that place where you're supposed to be <unk> it had to feel so safe and bought three <unk>
One of them had in the <unk> of the car.
Another he kept it underneath the pillow in our bed and the third always in his pocket.
And he said that I needed those guns because of the trauma that lived of tiny.
I needed it to be safe.
But those guns were actually a message to me, and even though I had never got up my hand, my life was already in serious danger, every minute of every day.
The first physical attack in <unk> happened five days before our wedding.
It was seven in the morning and I still had <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises of my neck had disappeared, I put my girlfriend suit out of my mother and married him.
In spite of what had occurred, I was sure that we lived happy forever, because I loved him, and he loved him and I wanted a lot.
And I was very, very <unk>
It just became very <unk> for the wedding and the fact of making a family with me.
It had been an isolated accident, and I would never get any harm.
I spent twice as our <unk>
The first time I was driving into a secret beach, and he was <unk> and he gave me so strong in the head that I <unk> several times against the <unk> of the car.
And then a couple of days later, driving back our honey moon. It was spreading through the traffic and threw me a Big Mac <unk> to the face.
<unk> kept <unk> one or twice a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage.
I was <unk> when I thought it was the only thing in this situation.
One in three American women is the victim of domestic violence or bullying at some time of his life, and the Center for Disease Control that every year 15 million children are <unk> 15 million children are <unk>
So, actually, I had very good company.
So back to my question: Why did I get <unk>
The answer is simple.
I didn't know he was abusing me.
Instead, I was a very strong woman, in love with a profoundly <unk> man in love and was the only person in the world who could help <unk> to face the <unk>
The other question that everybody does is, why do you just not <unk>
Why not <unk> I could have gone at any time.
So for me this is the saddest and painful question that people do, because we led to us the victims, we know something that you normally <unk> is incredibly dangerous to abandon a <unk>
Because the last phase in the pattern of domestic violence is <unk>
More than 70 percent of the killing of domestic violence happen after the victim has turned to the relationship, after <unk> because then the <unk> has nothing to lose.
Other implications include the permanent shell, even after the <unk> has returned to marriage, <unk> of financial resources, and delivery of the family court system to protect the victim and their children, who are usually forced by the judges to spend time not with the man who <unk> their mother.
And yet we continue to ask why it's just not going?
I was able to go, because of one last <unk> I will beat my denial.
I realized that the man who loved my loved so I would have killed if there was allowed.
So I broke silence.
I told the whole world: the police, my neighbor, my friends and family friends and family strangers, and I'm here today because all of you are <unk>
We have the tendency to <unk> victims like <unk> <unk> women, <unk> goods.
The question, "Why is it <unk>
For some people this is a way to say <unk> is it by <unk> as if the <unk> victims intentionally <unk> men who want to be <unk>
But since I published <unk> <unk> I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who were also <unk> who learned a lesson from what happened to the country and that they would make their lives joyful and their lives joyful and mothers, lives completely free of violence, like mine.
Because it turns out that I'm actually a victim and a survivor.
I went back to <unk> with a <unk> man, and we have those three children.
I have that black <unk> and also that <unk>
What I'm not going to get to have ever more, ever is a <unk> gun pointing out my head in the hands of someone who he wants to me.
Right now, it's just like thinking, <unk> that is <unk> or <unk> what silly <unk> but all this time I've actually been talking about you.
I assure you there are a few people who are listening to me right now, that are being <unk> or that they were <unk> or they're <unk> themselves.
<unk> could be affecting their daughter, to her sister, to their best friend right now.
I was able to get my way to my mad love breaking up silence.
And I keep doing it today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last request for you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
The abuse is only in silence.
They have the power to end up with domestic violence simply throwing light on it.
The victims of the world.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
They had the abuse of the light talking about it with their children, their <unk> their friends and family.
<unk> their vision of survivors as fantastic people and <unk> who have a future <unk>
<unk> the traditional signs of violence to intervene consciously, to slow down their climb and show the victims of a safe safely.
Together, we can turn our beds, our tables and our families into the <unk> secure and <unk> that they should be.
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Cameron <unk> and for a while, I am a model.
To be <unk> for 10 years ago.
And I feel like this moment is a uncomfortable tension in the room because I shouldn't have dressed like this.  luckily, I've brought clothes to <unk>
This is the first shift of clothing on a <unk> scenario so you have a lot of luck -- I think.
If some of the women are <unk> when they <unk> you don't have to get them up now, but I want to find out later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think of me in just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
These are a two-inch heel.
The worst part is going to go through this sweater on the head, because it's when you're going to laugh at me, so you don't do anything while hits my head.
All right.
Why did I do that?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope not as much as this picture.
The appearance is powerful, but also <unk>
I've completely changed what they thought of me in six seconds.
And in this picture, I had never had a boyfriend in real life.
I was totally uncomfortable and the photographer told me that he <unk> my back, and he <unk> the child's hair.
Of course, except with surgery or an artificial kingdom like the one I did two days ago for the work, there are very little that we can do to transform our way out, which, even though superficial and <unk> it has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, for me, being brave means to be honest.
I'm on this stage because I'm a model, I'm on this.
Because I'm a nice, white, woman, and in my labor sector, that's being a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do, but <unk>
The first question is, how do you get to be model?
And I always say, <unk> <unk> but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I became model is because he won the genetic lottery. And I'm the <unk> of a <unk> and maybe you're wondering what is this inheritance.
Well, in the last centuries we have not just defined beauty as health, and youth and symmetry, which we're biologically programmed to <unk> we also have associated with a high and <unk> shape, and a white skin.
And that's my heritage <unk> that I've known to take for making money.
And I know that there are people in the audience who now shows <unk> and maybe there are some <unk> <unk> <unk> They are <unk> <unk> Joan <unk> <unk> <unk>
First of all, the <unk> for knowing as much as models. It's amazing.
But unfortunately I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student at New York City and he told each other and each of the models in the <unk> and the <unk> models, just <unk> -- I mean, less than four percent, they were not white.
The next question that people always ask me is: Can it be a model when <unk>
And my first answer is: I don't know, I didn't take care of that.
But then what I would really tell you about every one of these girls is: Why? Can you be what you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or a surgeon <unk> ninja and poet, which would be awesome, because you're the first.
If you after this spectacular list, I still <unk> No, no, Cameron, I want to be model, I say, I know my <unk>
Because I am not in charge of anything, and you could be the <unk> <unk> <unk> or the CEO of <unk> or the next Steven <unk>
To say that you most want to be model is like saying you want to win the lottery when you become larger.
It's out of your control, it's amazing, and it's not a job that you can choose.
I'm going to demonstrate everything that I learned in 10 years as a model, because, unlike <unk> surgery, can be summed up right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, once you've got your studies, and have a copy and a copy of jobs to your backs, no matter what you want, is to say, if you want to be president of the United States, but you want to be president of the United States, but you have to look <unk>
The next question that people have always done me is if all of the photos are <unk>
And yes, virtually all the pictures, but that's just a small part of what happens.
This was the first picture that I was <unk> and also the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even have my <unk>
I know we're going to be entering the personal field, but it was a girl.
This is how I used to my grandmother a few months earlier.
These two photos are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I am in a <unk> party a few days before photos for French <unk>
Here I am with my football team and in <unk> magazine.
And this is me today.
And I hope you realize I'm not myself in those pictures.
They're <unk> of a group of professionals, <unk> <unk> photographers and <unk> and all their <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and they get to create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people always ask me is to make things for free?
I have too many inches of six inches and I never use, except the pair before, but the privilege that I get is the ones that I get in real life, and that we don't like to talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and I once went to a shop and I forgot to take money, and they gave me the free dress to me.
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> he jumped on a red light and of course we were <unk> and <unk> an <unk> agent in order to keep <unk>
<unk> of these privilege -- I look at it, not because of what I am. And there are people who are paying a price for how no matter who they are.
I live in New York, and the past year, of the <unk> teenagers who stood up and 86 percent were black and Latino were and most of them were young men.
And there are only <unk> young black and Latino men in New York, so for them, it's not a question of <unk>
It is how many times I get <unk> and <unk>
By looking at this talk, I learned that in 53 percent of the age of 13 years in the United States they don't like their body, and that figure rises at at 78 percent to the 17.
So the last question that people ask me is: How is the life of a role model?
And I think the answer that you're expecting is: If you're a bit slower and you have the most brilliant hair, you'll feel very happy and beautiful.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe you will.
<unk> It's really wonderful to travel, and also incredible power to work with creative people.
And that's all true, but it's just a part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras -- what I've never said in front of them, is: I'm insecure.
And I'm because I have to worry about my aspect every day.
And if you ever ask yourself, and with some better legs and the brightest hair will be happier?
They just have to meet with a set of models, because they have the most expensive legs and the brightest hair and their clothes, but probably women physically <unk> on the planet.
But mostly it was hard to analyze a situation of racial oppression and gender when I'm one of the biggest <unk>
If there is something to retain from this talk, I hope you all feel more comfortable in recognizing the power of the image in the perception we have from success and failure.
Thank you.
The photograph has been my passion for me to be high enough to attach a camera, but I want to share with you my 15 more <unk> pictures -- and I wasn't who the <unk>
There were no directors of no <unk> no chance to repeat the photos, not even a little bit of care in lighting.
In fact, most of them took them tourists at random.
My story starts when, <unk> in New York City to give a <unk> my wife took me this photo holding my daughter on the day of his first birthday. That's the corner of <unk> and five and 5.
He had a chance that we went back to New York City just a year later, so we decided to take the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes right now.
When the third birthday of my daughter, my wife told me, why don't you take care of New York on a <unk> journey.
So here is when we start asking the tourists that they were going to get the photo.
It's amazing that the gesture of getting the camera to a complete stranger to be so universal.
No one has been denied and, fortunately, nobody has <unk> with the camera.
So we weren't aware of how much life would change this journey.
It became something sacred to us.
This photo is a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day that a five-year-old would understand it.
These pictures are much more than a particular moment or a specific journey.
They're also a way to stop time on a week of October, and to make us reflect on our time and our evolution over the years, and not just the physical level, but in all the senses.
Because, while we always took the same picture, our perspective changes, my daughter gets new <unk> and I can see life through his eyes and how you perceive and interact with everything.
That particular time that we spent together is something that we expect with illusion every year.
Recently, in one of travel, we were walking, when suddenly he stopped in the dry and pointed out a red <unk> of the <unk> store that <unk> in the previous <unk>
And he described me what was in the five years of foot in that same place.
<unk> that reminded that he remembered his heart <unk> with force to see that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what you look at in New York is universities, because it's determined to study in New York City.
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things we created is memories.
So I want to share the idea of actively participate in creating conscious memories.
I don't know about you, but apart from these 15 pictures, I won't go out in many of the family pictures.
I'm always a picture.
I want to encourage you all to come up in the picture, and you don't get to go close to someone and ask him, you get a picture?
Thank you.
I'd like to talk about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
<unk> are found in the most <unk> birds.
First of all, why do you have so bad <unk>
It's also associated with Disney <unk> <unk> like <unk> silly characters.
More recently, if you have been following the press <unk> laughter, applause and <unk> these are the attributes that associate with Parliament <unk> But I don't accept it.
I don't accept it. You know why?
Because the members of Parliament don't keep the environment.  <unk> don't help prevent disease <unk>
<unk> are <unk>   They're far from <unk>  And my favorite, the <unk> have better presence.
There are the <unk> of the New World who are mostly in the <unk> like the <unk> and the <unk> and the U.S. <unk> -- where we have 16 species of these 16, 11 face a high risk of extinction.
So why is it important? First, First, provide ecological services.
It's our <unk> <unk>
They got the cadavers down to the bone.
They help killing all the bacteria that are helping to absorb anthrax -- that not for them would stretch and cause great losses to livestock and diseases in other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no <unk> the cadavers take three to four times more time in <unk> and this has huge ramifications of the spread of disease.
<unk> also have tremendous importance.
They've been associated with the ancient culture of <unk>
<unk> was the symbol of lip and maternity and, along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between the High and <unk>
In <unk> <unk> <unk> was the god <unk> and risked his life to save the <unk> goddess of 10 heads <unk>
In <unk> culture, they do very important <unk> to open <unk> in places like Tibet, open, there's no place to bury the dead, or wood or wood to <unk> so these <unk> provide a natural elimination system.
What's the problem with the <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, which six are in extreme <unk>
The reason is that they're being <unk> and the reason that they're being <unk> is because there are conflicts between humans and <unk> communities are using this venom venom against predators, and as a result, <unk> are victims of this.
In southern Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are on the critical critical list, which means that in less than 10 or 15 years old, and the reason is because they fall prey from the consumption of livestock that has been treated with a drug <unk> like <unk>
This drug has been banned to use veterinarian in India and have taken a statement.
Because there is no <unk> there has been a spread in the number of dogs in <unk> and when you have <unk> dogs has a huge time bomb, and the number of cases has increased in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the biggest wind farms in Africa, <unk> <unk> are going to be the top of Lake <unk>
I'm not against wind energy, but we have to work with governments, because wind turbines do this to birds. They cut them in half.
They're <unk>
In West Africa, there's a horrible drug of <unk> dead to serve the <unk> and the <unk> market.
So what are you doing? Well, we're researching these birds. We're <unk>
We're trying to determine its basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see that they travel through different countries, so to focus on a full-time problem it's not going to serve anything.
We have to work with governments in the <unk>
We're working with local communities.
We're talking to them about appreciating the <unk> about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that we <unk>
How can you help? It can make noise. You can write a letter to your government and tell you, we need to focus on these very <unk> creatures.
When you go out of this room, you will tell you about the <unk> but talk to their families, with their children, with their neighbors about <unk>
These are very <unk> Charles Darwin said it changed because he saw them fly without effort, no energy spending in the heavens.
Kenya, this world will be much more poor without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every thing I do, and everything I do -- my life -- has been <unk> for seven years of work in Africa.
From <unk> to <unk> <unk> young -- but I'm no longer I am.  I worked in Zambia, Kenya, <unk> Coast of <unk> <unk> and Somalia.
I worked for an NGO <unk> and every project that we set up in sub-Saharan Africa.
And I was <unk>
We were going to go to the 21, which Italians were good people, and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Instead of that, everything you would do, you know?
Our first project, which inspired my first book, <unk> from <unk> was a project where a few Italians decided to teach the people in Zambia to grow food.
So we got up with <unk> <unk> to the south Valley of Zambia to this absolutely magnificent valley that descends into the river <unk> and we teach local <unk> tomatoes and <unk> and <unk>
Of course, the people weren't at all interested in doing that -- so they encouraged them to come to work, and sometimes they didn't have <unk>  We were amazed that the local in so that the local, in so fertile valley, would not have any agriculture.
However, instead of asking them how it was possible that we were not going to make anything, we simply said, "Thank God that we are here --  <unk> for time to save the people of the <unk>
And of course, everything in Africa grew <unk>
We got these magnificent <unk> in Italy, a tomato would grow to this size. In Zambia, this size.
And we couldn't believe it, we were saying to the <unk> "Look how easy it is <unk>
When the tomatoes were beautiful and <unk> and red at night to the morning, about 200 <unk> showed up from the river and ate everything.  And we said, "Oh my God, my God, the <unk>
And the <unk> said, "Yes, that's why we don't have agriculture here."  "Why don't you do it? You never <unk>
I thought we only were Italians to make errors in Africa, but then I saw what the Americans, were doing what the Americans, they were doing, and then to see what they were doing, I felt pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, as you see, at least we feed the <unk>
So let's see the <unk> --  <unk> -- seeing the waste that would give them to <unk> people from Africa.
She wants to read a book, read <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The book was published in 2009.
We, political donors have delivered to the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you the damage that that money has <unk>
They just read your book.
It was part of an African woman, the damage we've done.
The Westerners are <unk> thousands, <unk> and we treat people just two things: or <unk> or we're <unk>
The two words come from the Latin root <unk> which means <unk>
But they mean two different things.
<unk> I deal with any of a different culture like my kids, "I want a lot."
<unk> I deal with all of a different culture as well as my <unk>
So white people in Africa are called <unk>
That book gave me a slap in the face, "The <unk> <unk> written by <unk> who said because of all economic development, if people don't want to be <unk> <unk> alone.
This should be the first beginning of aid.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, the guy who opened this conference, put a stick on the ground and said, we can -- you can tell a city that is not <unk>
I decided to go for the 27 years just to respond to people, and invent a system called <unk> <unk> where you ever start, you never ask anyone, but it becomes a <unk> of local passion, the <unk> of the local people who have the dream of becoming a better person.
So what does you? Are you <unk>
It never comes to a community with an idea, and it sits with the people in the <unk>
We don't work from offices.
We met in a cafe. We met in a bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we found out what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give an idea to someone.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what do you do?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that man has for his own general growth is the most important thing.
And then we help them find knowledge because nobody in the world can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years and years ago, I had this idea: Why not us, for once instead of getting to a community to tell people what to do, why not, for once, they were <unk> but not in community meetings.
I'll tell you a secret.
There's a problem with the community meetings.
<unk> never <unk> and they will never tell you about a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what a chance have been <unk>
So planning has this blind thing.
The smartest people in their community, you don't even know about it, because they're not attending their public meetings.
What do we do? We worked one one, and we work face to face, you have to create a social infrastructure, which doesn't exist.
You must create a new profession.
The profession is the family doctor of the company, the family doctor of the business -- which is set up with you in your house, at the table of their kitchen, in the coffee table, and that helps to find the resources to transform their passion in a way of living.
I started this as a test in <unk> city of Western Australia, city.
I was doing a Ph.D. in that time, trying to get away from this <unk> <unk> where we got to tell them what to do.
In one year, I had 27 projects going on, and the government came to me to see to ask, "How can you do that?
How can I do that? And I said, "I did something really, really hard.
And I was <unk> and <unk>   So the government says, <unk> again.  We've done it in 300 communities in the world.
We have helped to start 40,000 businesses.
There is a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of loneliness.
Peter <unk> one of the greatest business <unk> of the story, passed away from '96, a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a philosophy professor before getting involved in business, and this is what Peter <unk> says, <unk> is actually incompatible with a society and a company <unk>
planning is the kiss of death of the business of business.
So now by now <unk> rebuilding <unk> without knowing what the most <unk> people in <unk> want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to talk to you.
You have to offer your privacy, it has to be fantastic to the <unk> and then it's going to come up in mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we got 200 customers.
You can imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and passion?
What presentation is you going to make more this tomorrow?
<unk> <unk> That's what you have <unk>
So what I'm telling you is that the entrepreneurial spirit is where it is.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution -- we are at the end of the fossil revolution -- we are at the end of the <unk> <unk> and one moment to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
The <unk> as a form of holding <unk> it's not sustainable.
What we have to consider, is how <unk> <unk> <unk> communicate to seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There are no technologies to do it.
Who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution, <unk> <unk>
The government?
They'll be entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There's an extraordinary story that I read in a futuristic magazine many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to debate the future of New York City in the year.
And in the year <unk> he gathered this group of people, and <unk> what would happen to the city of New York in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> New York City wouldn't exist within 100 years.
Why? Because they analyzed the curve and <unk> if the population keeps growing up to this <unk> to move to the population of New York to the <unk> <unk> six million horses, and the manure produced by six million horses, would be impossible to <unk>
They were already taken away from dung.  So in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty technology that would be <unk> in New York City.
So what happens? In the next 40 years, in 1900, in 1900, in the United States <unk> generic companies <unk> <unk>
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very few factories that were very <unk>
<unk> Michigan. Henry Ford Ford Ford <unk>
But there is a secret to work with the entrepreneurs.
First, you have to offer them <unk>
Otherwise, they won't come to conversation with you.
Then you have to offer absolute <unk>
And then I have to have to tell you the truth about <unk>
The smallest company, the biggest company, the biggest company, has to be able to do three things: the product that you want to sell has to be fantastic, you have to have a fantastic marketing -- and you have to share with a great <unk>
Guess what?
We've never met a single human being in the world that I can do, sell and look for money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This is still not born.
We've looked at research and looked at the 100 companies icons in the Carnegie <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> all the new companies, Google, <unk>
There is only one thing that all the successful companies in the world have in common, only one, no one was started by one person.
Never the word <unk> but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't just when it started.
Nobody starts a company itself.
So we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from a small business environment on coffee bars and on the bars of bars along the bars of bars with the comrades who will do for you, what someone did for this <unk> who talks about this <unk> someone who is asking you, what do you need?
What can you? Can you do it?
Well, you can see it, can you look for the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do that." <unk> who seeks <unk>
We activate communities.
Thank you.
<unk> around you can help us in many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so we don't swap a lot of knowledge in spite of sharing the same public spaces.
In the last few years, I've tried to share more with my neighbors in the public space, with simple tools like <unk> templates and chalk.
These projects come from questions like, how much do my neighbors pay for their <unk>
How can we pay and borrow more things without calling the door at a bad time?
How do we share more memories of our abandoned buildings and better understand our <unk>
How do we share our hopes for the empty stores so that our communities can reflect our needs of our needs and <unk>
I live in New York City, and I'm in love with New York City.
My soul always finds relief with the giant poison and a shadow of <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries, and I trust a city town.
That is always supporting music --  there's a <unk> in New York City,  The city has one of the most beautiful architectures in the world, but also one with the biggest number of American <unk>
I live close to this house, and I thought how could it turn it into a rather nice space for the neighborhood and also something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost someone who loved a lot.
It was <unk> as a mother to <unk>
His death was sudden and unexpected.
I thought a lot about death and death and I thought a lot.
And this made me a deep gratitude for the life and that made me a lot of gratitude for the living time.
It gave the significant things about my life today.
But let's try to keep this look in my everyday life.
It seems to me that it's easy to be able to catch up the day and forget what's really important for you.
So with the help of old friends and new friends turned the wall out of this home house on a giant <unk> and he painted about her <unk> <unk>
So the <unk> could take a <unk> thinking about their lives and to share aspirations in public space.
I didn't know what to wait for this experiment but the next day the wall was filled and still <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
Before he died I want to be <unk> by <unk>  "Before I die I want to sit on the line of <unk>
Before he died I want to sing for millions of people."
Before he died I want to plant a <unk>
Before he died I want to live outside the <unk>
Before he died I want to give you one again."
Before he died I want to go to the <unk>
Before he died I want to be completely myself."
This abandoned space became <unk> and the dreams and hope of people made me laugh at me laughing <unk> and made me comfort in difficult times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It's about understanding our neighbors in new ways and <unk> it's about giving the reflection to the reflection and the <unk> and of remembering what is most important for us as we grow and <unk>
This happened last year, and I started getting hundreds of messages from passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community.
So with my colleagues in the civic center, we made a kit and now have been made walls in countries around the world, like <unk> South Africa, Australia, Argentina and beyond.
Together, we proved the power of our public spaces if we give us the opportunity to express ourselves and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things we have is time and our relationships with other people.
In our era of distractions increasing, it's more important than ever, to find ways to maintain the perspective and remember that life is brief and fragile.
death is something we often avoid talking about, or even thinking, but I understood that preparing for death is one of those things that would be more power.
If you think about death <unk> our life.
Our spaces shared that we can reflect better than we care about as individuals and as community and more means to share hope, fears and stories, the people that surrounds us cannot help improve places, can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have one request.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my siblings.
<unk> is 22 and very <unk>
No speech, but it brings joy better than some of the best speakers.
<unk> knows what love.
It comes <unk> pass what will happen.
It's not <unk> You don't look at the color of the skin.
It doesn't matter the religious differences and notice on this: it's never <unk>
When I singing songs from our childhood, trying to say the words that I wouldn't even be able to do, it reminds me of one thing: how little we know about the mind and how wonderful it must be the unknown.
Samuel is 16 years old. It's very hot.
<unk> memory <unk>
Yet it's a selective memory.
It doesn't remember if I stole my <unk> but remember the year when he came out of the songs of my iPod, conversations that we grew up when I was four years old, and you would feel in my arm during the first episode of the <unk> and the Lady birthday.
It doesn't seem <unk>
But most people don't agree.
And in fact, because their minds don't fit into the concept of normal society, they're often <unk> and <unk>
But what propelled my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case, although you wouldn't consider it inside the <unk> that could only mean one thing: which was <unk> people and extraordinary <unk>
Now, for those less familiar with the term <unk> it's a complex brain disorder that affects social communication, learning and sometimes physical skills.
In each individual in each individual in the form of a different way -- that <unk> is so different to Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes, will be diagnosed a new case of autism, and even though it's one of the disorders of development that the faster it increases in the world, there is no cause and <unk>
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without it.
I was just three years when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited to have a new self in my life.
When a few months, I realized he was different.
It took a lot.
I didn't want to play like the other babies, and in fact, didn't look very interested in me at all.
<unk> and <unk> in his own world, with their own rules, and I would find pleasure in the smallest things, like putting cars in line around the room, looking at the machine and eat anything that would have been <unk>
As I grew up, it became more different, and the differences were made more evident.
But beyond the <unk> the frustration and the <unk> <unk> there was something really <unk> a pure and innocent nature -- a kid who looked at the world with no biases, a human being had never <unk>
<unk>
I can't deny there have been some difficult moments in my family, times when I wish that they were just like me.
But I look back at the things that I've taught me about individuality, communication and love, and I realize that these are things that I wouldn't want to change for normal.
<unk> goes through the beauty that give us the differences and the fact of being different doesn't mean that some is wrong.
It just means that there's a different view of what's right.
If I could take a single thing to <unk> and Sam and Sam and you don't have to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because autistic or not, the differences that <unk> are a <unk> each one of us has a gift in their inner and, honestly, the search for normal, is the ultimate sacrifice of potential.
The opportunity for <unk> progress and change in the moment when we're trying to be like others.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit what must have been <unk> in the country of <unk>
Penn State was asked me, a teacher of communications that gave a kind of communication to engineering students.
I was scared.  <unk> <unk> of these students with their great minds, their great books and their great unknown words.
But in the developing those conversations, I felt what it was supposed to have felt when he fell through the hole in the rabbit hole and saw the door of a new world.
I just felt that I felt when I had these conversations with the students, I was surprised by the ideas that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to opening that door is a big communication.
We desperately need a huge communication of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientific and engineers are attacking our largest challenges from energy to medium and health care and health care -- and if we don't know that we don't understand this, the work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as we were not scientists to have these interactions.
But these big conversations cannot happen if our scientists and engineers don't invite us to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please, <unk> with <unk>
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do it to make sure that your science is sexy and its engineering is attractive.
First question for <unk> and then what?
So why is science relevant to us.
Don't tell us simply studying <unk> but studying the <unk> that are the mesh structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat the <unk>
And when you're describing their science, careful about <unk>
The slang is an obstacle to our understanding of their ideas.
Sure, you can say <unk> and <unk> but why not say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> affordable is not the same thing that make them silly as well.
Instead, as Einstein said, it's all as simple as possible, but not simple.
They can communicate clearly his science without engaging ideas.
Something to consider is to use examples, and stories and analogies. These are ways to connect and engage with their content.
And by presenting your job, forget about the signs of <unk>
They have wondered why they call <unk>  What do they do about <unk> <unk> kill them and <unk> their presentation.
A <unk> like this is not just boring, but it's supported too much in the area of the language of our brain and <unk>
Instead, this <unk> of example from <unk> Brown is much more effective. It shows that the special structure of <unk> is so strong that it really inspired the only design of the <unk> <unk>
The trick here is to use a simple sentence -- <unk> that the audience can understand if you lose a little bit, and then they provide graphs that are going to go to our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding of what you would get.
I think these are just some key ones that you can help to open the door and see the country of wonders that is science and engineering.
And so, scientists and engineers, when they solved this equation, by all media, <unk> with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words from the entire Oxford English English is <unk>
Just because it sounds very well.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Although there was an editor <unk> of the 19th century, which defined it much better when he said, "A <unk> is that looking for a public charge without whether or <unk> platform, and that, when he won, it gets by the mere use of a monumental <unk>
I have no idea what it means <unk>
Something you do with the words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the basis in politics, and that all the politicians know that they have to try to dominate the language.
It wasn't <unk> for example, that the British Parliament allowed the newspapers to quote the exact words that were said in the <unk> camera.
And all of this was thanks to the bravery of a guy with <unk> name of <unk> <unk> who was confronted by <unk>
He was thrown in the Tower of London and <unk> but he had enough courage to deal with them, and finally had such a popular support in London that I won.
And just a few years later we had the first use of the phrase <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> like <unk>
Most of you think it's <unk>
It isn't. It's because of an advocate of freedom of expression.
But to show you really how words and politics interact, I want you to go back to America, right after independence.
So they had to address the question of how to call George Washington, his leader.
You didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a country <unk>
This is <unk> in Congress for a long time.
These are all kinds of suggestions that you might have <unk>
Some of them wanted to call him <unk> <unk> and others, "Your <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> from the U.S. <unk>
Not very <unk>
Some of them just wanted to call it <unk>
They thought that it was <unk> quality.
And not even that was <unk> they had the idea that you could be elected King for a fixed term.
And I might have <unk>
All the world got tired of the world to be tired because this debate was <unk> for three weeks.
I read the newspaper from a poor <unk> and always <unk> <unk> with this <unk>
What caused the <unk> and the <unk> was that the House House was against the <unk>
The House House did not want me to be Washington <unk>
They didn't want to call him whether it was to him or his designated ideas.
So they wanted to give him the most <unk> <unk> title that they came up with.
And that title was <unk>
President's didn't invent the title.
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have much more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There were <unk> presidents of small <unk> <unk> and <unk> of government, but it was really a insignificant.
And so the Senate <unk>
They said, "is ridiculous, we can't call it <unk>
This guy has to sign treaties and meet with <unk> <unk>
"And who will take a serious title with a ridiculous title of <unk>
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate didn't exist.
We can learn three interesting things about this.
First of all, and this is my favorite thing to where I've been able to figure out, the Senate has never been <unk> as the title of President.
President Barack Obama was lucky to keep up there, waiting for the Senate to be in action.
The second thing that we can learn is that when a government says a measure is <unk>  <unk> possible for us to continue to go for <unk>
But the third thing we can learn, and this is the most important thing, and I want to tell you, is that the President of President of America doesn't sound as modest today, right?
Especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear warheads in note, the largest economy in the world and a fleet of unmanned air vehicles and so on.
The reality and history have laced the title of <unk>
So eventually I won the <unk>
They got their title of <unk>
And also the other concern about the Senate, <unk> well, it was a <unk>
But you know how many nations have now <unk>
And everything because they want to sound like the <unk> and the 5,000 nuclear heads.
So, at the end the Senate won and the House of <unk> <unk> because no one is going to feel humble when you tell them now that are the President of <unk>
And I think that's the great lesson we can learn, and I think that I'd like to get to you.
Politicians try to choose and use the words to shape and control reality, but really, really change change the words that what these might change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 to feet underground in an illegal mine in Ghana.
The air is <unk> and dust and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of bodies in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear voices that speak but above all, that cacophony of <unk> male and rocks rocks with primitive.
Like others, I carry a cheap firefly of light on the head with this <unk> <unk> and I can barely distinguish the <unk> branches that hold on the walls of that <unk> hole that drops hundreds of feet into the ground.
It <unk> my hand and suddenly I remember a <unk> I met days before, that he lost the control and dropped countless feet in that well.
As I talk to you today, these men are deep in that hole by putting their lives with no reward and often dying.
I went out of that hole and I went home, but they probably never will, because they're prey from slavery.
In the last 28 years I was documenting native cultures in more than 70 countries in six continents, and in 2009, I had the great honor of being the only <unk> in the G8 <unk>
Among all the amazing people that I met there I met an <unk> <unk> the <unk> a NGO which is involved in <unk> modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and really, I began to learn about slavery because I knew that there was a world in the world, but not as a grade.
When we ended up talking to me, I was very sad, I honestly was afraid of ignoring this <unk> of our days, and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
He got choked up, my stomach and weeks later, I flew to Los Angeles to meet the director of <unk> the <unk> and offer my help.
So I started my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, I've already been in many of these sites.
A few of them even considered my second home.
But this time, <unk> the dirty <unk>
A conservative calculation is that there are now more than 27 million people in the world.
It's twice as much as the numbers of Africans displaced throughout the slave of slave people.
150 years ago, the cost of a farmer was about three times the annual salary of a U.S. worker.
This is the equivalent of about 50,000 days.
However, today, you can be enslaving entire families by generations by tax <unk>
<unk> slavery generates profits from over 13 billion dollars a year across the world.
Many of them have been <unk> with false education promise and better work to then discover that they're forced to work without pay, under <unk> violence and cannot escape.
Today slavery operates in the <unk> the goods produced by slaves have value, but those who produce them are disposable them.
<unk> exists in almost everybody else, and yet, it's illegal to all over the world.
In India and Nepal, I met the bricks.
This strange show was like to go into the old Egypt or the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> at a temperature of 54 C, men, women, kids, in fact, entire families -- in a heavy heavy, <unk> stack of bricks in their heads, until 18 at the time, and they take them from <unk> furnaces to trucks that are at hundreds of feet.
<unk> by <unk> and <unk> work in silence, doing this task over and over again for 16 or 17 hours a day.
There were no pause to eat, not to drink, and the severe <unk> made it pee out pretty <unk>
And so <unk> were the heat and the dust that my camera became too hot and <unk> and stopped working.
Every 20 minutes, I had to run the car to clean up the team and make it work with air conditioning for <unk> and, sitting there, I thought my camera receives a much better treatment than these people.
Back in the furnaces I wanted to cry, but the <unk> who was on my side quickly grabbed me and said, <unk> don't do it." You don't do it. Don't do it.
And it explained to me very clearly that demonstrate emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not just for me but for them.
I couldn't offer direct help.
I couldn't give them money, anything.
I was not the citizenship of that country.
I could put it in a worse situation than they already were.
I had to trust <unk> the <unk> and work within the system by his release and he trusted her to <unk>
In terms of me, I waited to get home to feel my heart <unk>
In the Himalayas, I found children carrying rocks over a mile per <unk> ground to trucks waiting down.
These big <unk> were more heavy than the children who had charge and children <unk> their heads with <unk> <unk> made of stereotypes and <unk>
It's hard to see something so <unk>
How can we influence something so <unk> but so <unk>
Some of you don't even know that they're slaves -- and they work 16 or 17 hours a day without <unk> because this has been all his life.
They have nothing to <unk>
When these villagers <unk> his freedom, the <unk> had completely gotten their houses.
When you hear the word <unk> we often think of sexual trafficking, and because of this global consciousness, they warned me that it would be difficult for me to work with security in this particular business.
In <unk> I was <unk> women who had been previously <unk>
I was driven by some stairs <unk> that gave this dirty <unk> <unk> <unk>
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was rather a restaurant.
<unk> as he knows in the craft, they're local for forced prostitution.
They have small rooms, private where the <unk> <unk> with their girls and kids, some of them just seven -- they're forced to <unk> the customers and <unk> to buy more food and alcohol.
Each place is dark and dirty, they identified by a number painted on the wall and divided through a <unk> and a curtain.
The workers often suffer sex abuse to their clients.
And standing in <unk> I remember making sense of a <unk> <unk> and, at that instant, I could barely imagine what it should be stuck in that <unk>
I only had a <unk> the stairs where they were <unk>
There was no <unk>
There was no windows big enough to <unk>
Those people don't have <unk> and, because we touch a subject so hard, it's important to point out that slavery, even sexual traffic is happening around us.
There are hundreds of people embedded in agriculture, in <unk> in the domestic service, and the list can continue.
Recently, New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 American children are sold every year as sex slaves.
It's everywhere, but we don't see it.
The textiles is another activity that often relate to <unk> labor.
I visited Indian villages where there were whole families embedded in the silk trade.
This is a family.
The black hands are the father, the <unk> of blue and red, of his children.
<unk> <unk> in these big barrels and <unk> silk in the liquid to the <unk> but <unk> is <unk>
My guy told me his stories.
We don't have <unk> they said.
You still expect it to come out of this house someday and go to another place where we really pay for our job."
It's estimated that there are more than 4,000 children in Lake <unk> the largest oil lake in the world.
When we come, I was going to have a quick look.
I saw what it seemed like to be a fishermen on a boat, two older brothers, some younger kids, a lot younger children, makes sense, right?
<unk> They were all slaves.
Children are separated from their families and <unk> <unk> and forced them to work <unk> in these boats in the lake, despite not knowing how to swim.
This boy is eight years old.
When our boat came up to me was <unk> which his little canoe was <unk>
I was paralyzed by the fear of falling into the water.
The <unk> branches in the <unk> lake is often trap networks and children, <unk> and fear, it's thrown into the water to trigger the branches.
Many of them will be <unk>
Since remember, it's always been forced to work in the lake.
For fear of his love, it's not going to flee and, like all life has been treated with cruelty, <unk> is about the younger slaves under their charge.
I met these guys at five in the morning, when they <unk> the last networks, but they had been working on the one of the one in the way.
<unk> and <unk>
And you can point out that these networks weigh more than 400 kilos when they're packed with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued in a village of fishermen.
I met it in a hut where I was <unk> the <unk> <unk> to victims of slavery.
Kofi symbolizes as possible.
Who will be because of somebody decided to make a difference in your life?
<unk> by a road in Ghana with <unk> partners the <unk> a fellow <unk> with his bike.
They asked us to do it by a path of land to the forest.
At the end of the way, we were reluctant to get out of the car, and he asked the driver to go out quickly.
And then he pointed out this path and he said, "This is the way, this is the path.
As we started down, we removed the <unk> that <unk> the path and after walking close to an hour we found that the path was <unk> by the recent <unk> so I put the team of photos on my head as he <unk> in these waters to my chest.
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> road ended up in an clear, and we had a mass of holes that could fit into a soccer field, and everybody was full of <unk> workers.
Many women had strapped to their backs and, while they were looking for gold -- they were looking at <unk> water.
<unk> is used in the process of <unk>
These <unk> are <unk> in a well in another part of Ghana.
When they came out of the pump they were <unk> in their own sweat.
I remember looking at his eyes tired, <unk> since many had been under land for 72 hours.
<unk> are up to 300 feet and these people are carrying heavy stone bags that then will be transported to another area where they <unk> the stone to extract the gold.
In the first view, the site seems to be filled with strong men and <unk> but if you look closer to it, you see to work at some other fortunate and also children.
They're all victims of injuries, disease and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this <unk> is going to end up like this <unk> victim and <unk> in a few years.
This is <unk> When his father died he took him to work with him in the mines.
When he died his uncle, <unk> I got to have the debt of the uncle who force him to be slave in mines.
When I met her, I had worked in the 14 years and the leg injury that you see here is a product of an accident in the <unk> so serious that the doctors said it should be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has T.B. and yet yet, it's forced to work at night and day in that mine.
Yet, he dreams with being liberated and educated with local activists as <unk> the <unk> and it's this kind of determination, of face to a remote possibility -- which inspires me a lot of respect.
I want to throw light on slavery.
Did you know that their images would be seen for you all over the world.
I wanted you to have knew that we'll give testimony to them and that we will do everything we could to help change their lives.
I really believe that if we can see each other as human beings, then it becomes very difficult for atrocities like slavery.
These images are not from magazines. They are real people, like you and like me, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect in their lives.
There's no day that happens that I don't think about these so many beautiful people, <unk> that I've had the great honor of known.
I hope that these images actually wake up a force in which you can see them in people like you, and I hope that you will turn on a fire and that that fire <unk> light on slavery because, without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I make math applied and there's a peculiar problem for whom we <unk> are like management courses.
Nobody knows what the hell we do.
So today, I will try to explain to you what I do.
Dance is one of the most human activities.
We would take off the <unk> of the ballet and the dancers of <unk> --  that we'll see later.
But the ballet demand for a degree of extraordinary training, a high level of dexterity and probably some initial <unk> that can well have a genetic component.
Unfortunately, psychiatric disorders like Parkinson's Parkinson's -- destroy this extraordinary ability as it does with my friend <unk> <unk> who, in his age, it was a ballet ballet chef.
In the last few years, it has been moved through the treatment.
However, there are <unk> millions of people in the world who are sick, have to deal with a <unk> <unk> <unk> and other symptoms of this disease, so we need tools to detect the disease before it is too late.
We need to be able to measure progress in an objective way and ultimately, the only way we will know if there's really a cure to be when we have an objective measure and <unk>
But it's frustrating that for Parkinson's and other disorders of the movement in the movement there are no <unk> <unk> so they don't use blood analysis, and the best we have is a neurological <unk>
You have to go to a clinic, to do it. It's very, very expensive, and that means that outside clinical trials, they never do.
And what if patients could do it at home?
That would save a trip to the clinic. What if patients could do <unk>
It wouldn't be personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars.
So what I want to think about it is as not as conventional as a chance, you see, in some sense at least, we are all <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of vibration <unk>
It shows someone healthy while it emits sounds like speaking. We can imagine as dancers of a vocal ballet <unk> because we have to coordinate all those vocal organs to produce sounds and we all have the genes needed to produce the <unk> for example.
And just like <unk> it requires an extraordinary level of training.
Let's think about time that leads to a child learning to speak.
From the sound, we can trace the position of the vocal chords as it <unk> and as the Parkinson's affects the <unk> it also affects the <unk>
In the plot chart you can see an example of irregular <unk> from the elastic ropes of the ropes there.
We see the same <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
The speech becomes <unk> and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do you compare these tests based on the voice with <unk> clinical trials are both <unk>
The neurological test is not <unk> Both use existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole series of hospitals to do it.
Both are precise. Well, but also the <unk> tests are not <unk>
I mean, they can be <unk>
They do very quickly, they take about 30 seconds as a lot.
They're very minimal and we all know what happens.
And when something takes a cost so <unk> it shows mass scale.
These are some incredible goals for <unk>
We can reduce the patients <unk>
I would not have to go to the clinic for routine.
With high <unk> we could <unk> goals.
We could do this massive <unk> for clinical trials and for the first time, <unk> <unk> at scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of disease before it's too late.
So by giving the first steps in that sense, we're launching the Parkinson's disease.
Along with <unk> and <unk> we want to record a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and begin to address these goals.
We have local local lines for 750 million people in the world.
<unk> with or without Parkinson's, you can call it low price and give recordings for a few cents. And I'm pleased to announce that we've reached six percent of the goal in only eight hours.
Thank you.
What will you get from these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, yeah. What happens is that during the call you have to indicate if you have or not the disease.
<unk> You see, some people may not have <unk> You may not know it.
But we're going to get a very large sample of <unk> data in different circumstances, and do it in different circumstances is important because we're looking at <unk> the factors of confusion in search of the real markers of the disease.
TR: Do you have a accuracy accuracy at this time?
<unk> much more than that.
Actually, my student <unk> I have to have done a fantastic job, and now it has shown that it works on the mobile phone network, as well as we put the project. Now we have 99 percent accuracy.
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's a improvement.
<unk> Absolutely.
TR: Thank you very much. Max <unk> audience.
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March 2011, I was doing <unk> <unk> in New York City.
We're <unk> creatures.
We spread out in the dark, in rooms with no windows and usually avoid sunlight.
We make the thin models, even more <unk> the perfect skin is even more perfect -- we make the impossible, possible and we get into the press all the time, but some of us are truly artists with many years of experience and a real taste of imagery and photography.
On March 11 2011, I saw from my house, just like the rest of the world, the <unk> events that were happening in Japan.
Shortly after that, an organization where I was <unk> where <unk> <unk> was in the place working as part of the answer.
I, along with hundreds of other volunteers we knew that we couldn't stay at home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
On May I traveled to <unk>
It's a little <unk> village in the <unk> of almost 50,000 people, one of the first villages affected by the wave.
The level of water recorded over 24 feet tall and over three kilometers away from the inside.
As you can imagine, the people were <unk>
It <unk> rubble from channels and <unk>
<unk> schools. We took the slime up and leave them ready to be <unk> and <unk>
We took tons and tons of fish and tons of fish -- dead <unk>
We <unk> and loved it.
For weeks, both volunteers like neighbors found similar things.
They found pictures and <unk> pictures and cameras and cards.
Everybody did the same thing.
They were going to take them and bring them to different places of villages around the world.
It wasn't until I realized that those pictures represented a huge part of the personal losses that people had <unk>
As they were fleeing the wave, and to save their lives, they had to abandon absolutely everything they had.
At the end of my first week I started to help in a <unk> center of the people.
It helped clean the toilets, the huge <unk> gigantic <unk>
This place turned out to be the place in the village where the <unk> center, the photos.
And there they took and I had the honor of that day <unk> in me to clean up the photos.
This was exciting and inspiring, I had heard the expression beyond the <unk> but it wasn't until we moved through my horizons that something happened.
By looking at the pictures, I found some of them who had more than a hundred years old, some were still in the lab, I couldn't help to think about how to <unk> how to fix that <unk> and I knew hundreds of people that could do the same thing.
So that night I entered Facebook contacted some of them, and the next morning, the answer was as overwhelming and positive that I knew we had to try.
So we started <unk> the photos.
This was the first of all.
It wasn't too <unk> but where the water had gotten rid of the face of the girl I had a lot of precision and <unk>
Otherwise that little girl wouldn't have the aspect of it, and that would be as tragic as having the photo <unk>
At the time of time, they came up with a little bit more photos, and they needed more <unk> so he went back on Facebook and <unk> and five days later, 80 people from 12 countries volunteered to help.
Within two weeks I had 150 people from <unk>
In Japan, in July, we were invited to <unk> a village to the north of <unk>
Once a week we use our scanner in the temporal libraries that were <unk> where people were going to reclaim their photos.
The time that we have in <unk> is a different story, it depended on the <unk> of the photos.
I could take an hour. It could be a <unk> weeks.
It could be <unk>
This <unk> had to draw virtually by hand using the areas whose color and detail that water was not destroyed.
I took a long time.
The water destroyed all of these pictures long, covered in bacteria, with algae, even with oil, even with oil, all of that together with the time I continue to get out of the time, and I keep on my hand -- was an important part of the project.
We couldn't afford the photo unless it was clean and dry and was <unk> by his <unk>
We were lucky with <unk>
We tell the guidance of a <unk>
It's very easy to harm even more photos already <unk>
As I once said, the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us these pictures was kind of a relationship to the photos.
He had begun to <unk> herself but he stopped to realize that the <unk> even more.
I also had <unk>
Without them, the images of their husband and their own face would not have been able to reconstruct the images in a single picture, and they would take the whole picture of it.
When I picked up his pictures shared some of his story with us.
A few colleagues of his husband found the photos on a fire station between the rubble quite far away from where he used to be his house, but his colleagues got it.
The day of the tsunami, his husband was the experimenter to close the barriers to the wave.
He had to go inside the water as the <unk> <unk>
Her small children, not so small now, but their two children were in school in a different schools.
One of them was trapped in the water.
It took a week to find her entire family and knowing that everybody had survived.
The day that I gave her his child her younger son than he gave her her younger son.
For that, despite all this, those pictures were the best gift I could do something that he could go back to look at, something I could remember from the past that was not been marked by that day of March when everything in his life changed or was destroyed.
And after six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined there, hundreds of them helped us clean up the more of <unk> photographs -- the great majority of <unk> -- the great majority of their <unk> <unk>
More than 500 volunteers all over the world helped us give us to 90 families -- hundreds of photos completely <unk> and <unk>
During this time, we don't really spend more than 1,000 in teams and materials, most of the ink to <unk>
We take all the time.
A picture is a memory of someone or something, one place, a relationship, someone wanted.
They are <unk> of our memories and stories, the last thing we would take for us, but the first thing that we would look for.
This is what the project is to restore small pieces of humanity, to return to somebody who is connection to the past.
When a picture like this comes back to somebody, it's a huge difference in the life of the person that the <unk>
This project also made a big difference in the life of the <unk>
Some of them connected them with something bigger, will give something, using their talent for something that is not going to be thin models of perfect.
So I would like to read this electronic email. I sent him Cindy day that I came back from Japan after six months.
As I started, I couldn't avoid thinking about people and the stories shown in the images.
One in particular, a photo with women of different ages from the grandmother to the small girl, gathering around a baby, and I was <unk> because a similar picture of my family family -- my grandmother, my mother, me, and my newborn daughter hangs on our wall.
In the whole world, in all of our basic needs, the <unk> right?
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> inspired us wonder and curiosity with this photo of a bullet that goes through an apple in an exhibition in just a millionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not a million or a billion, to a billion frames per second.
I give you a new type of <unk> the <unk> a new technique so fast that you can create a slow camera of light on motion.
And with that, we can create cameras that you can see after the <unk> over the line of vision, or see the interior of the body without using X-rays, and challenge the camera idea.
If I take a laser pointer and I turn it up and put it into a <unk> <unk> in various <unk> create a <unk> pack.
And that set of photons, that <unk> travel at the speed of light, and again, a million times faster than a common bullet than a common.
If we take that bullet and this pile of photons and put it into this bottle, how do you disperse those photons into this <unk>
What is the aspect of the light in the <unk>
Now, all of this --  -- remember, this is actually happening in less than a <unk> is what it takes to travel to the light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so you can see light on motion.
Coca-Cola is not <unk> this research --  -- <unk> a lot of things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what's going on.
The pulse, our <unk> enters the bottle of a <unk> <unk> which starts <unk> and that, inside, it starts to <unk>
Part of the light is <unk> it's going to the table, and we started seeing these <unk>
A lot of photons finally come to the cap and then explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's a air bubble.
At that time, the waves travel by the table and because of the insights of the top you see at the bottom of the bottle, after various boxes, that the insights will be <unk>
Now, if we take a bullet and common and we make it run the same distance and we see it in slow motion to about 10 billion times, how much they think would take us to sit down to see that movie?
A week, a week?
It would be a very boring film, or a slow <unk> movement.
And how about <unk> nature <unk>
You can see the waves on the table, the tomato table, and the background wall.
It's like throwing a rock on a pond.
It's the way nature paints a picture, and I thought of a <unk> at the time, but of course, our eyes see a full composition of it.
But if you look at one more and more <unk> you'll realize that, as the light <unk> <unk> <unk>
Why? Because the tomato is <unk> and the light bounces inside its interior and comes back after several <unk> a second.
In the future, when this <unk> is in your mobile phones, they're going to be able to go to the supermarket and check if the fruit is grown without having to <unk>
Why do we create this camera at MIT? India?
As photographers, you know, if we take a photo to a <unk> it gets very little light up.
But we're going to go a billion times faster than the shortest exhibition -- so you can barely get some light.
We sent that <unk> that <unk> of photons, millions of times, and we recorded over and over again with a very <unk> <unk> we took these data <unk> and the <unk> <unk> to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all of these data in raw data and make it interesting.
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible.
And if a new power of a future <unk> would allow him to see after the <unk>
The idea is that we could throw a little bit of light on the door. We will go into the room, a part is going to reflect on the door, and from there to the camera.
where we could extract those multiple <unk> of light.
It's not science fiction. We already built it.
On the left, it's our <unk>
Behind the wall there is a dummy and <unk> the light on the door.
After the publication of our article in Nature <unk>
And a small fraction of the photons will come back to the camera, but interestingly, just slightly different moments.
And as we have a camera that works so fast, our <unk> has unique capacities in it.
It's got very good time resolution, and it can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances up to the door and also the hidden objects, but we don't know what a dot corresponds to what a distance.
When you project a laser you can record a photo <unk> which you see on the screen, it doesn't really make sense.
But we're going to take a lot of images like this, dozens of images, the <unk> and we will try to analyze the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we can see the object <unk>
Can we see it <unk>
This is our reconstruction for us.
We have things to explore before we get this in the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that <unk> collisions with what's going to turn around the curve, what's going to turn around.
Or we could look for survivors at dangerous conditions by looking at light reflected through open windows.
Or we could build <unk> you can see the inside of the body by <unk> and the same for the <unk>
But, of course, because of the tissue and the blood -- this is quite difficult, so this is actually a request to scientists so that they start thinking about <unk> as a new commission of visualization to solve the problems in the next generation.
So as <unk> <unk> he himself made science in art, an art of photographs <unk>
I realized that all the <unk> of data that we collect every time are not just for scientific visualizations but we can be able to see that we can see that we can can be able to see that we can see.
So creating a new form of computer photography with slow motion.
And look at those waves remember, the time between each of those waves is just about <unk> a second.
But here it is also a fun thing.
If you look at the waves under the <unk> these are going on from us.
The waves should move towards us.
What happens here?
It turns out that as we're recording almost at the speed of light, we have strange effects, Einstein would have loved to see this image.
The order that the events in the world is sometimes invested in the camera.
<unk> the corresponding warping of space and time, we can correct this <unk>
That's time. Thank you.
Hi. This is my mobile phone.
A mobile phone can <unk> life, and you get individual freedom.
With a mobile phone can <unk> a crime in Syria.
With a cell phone you can tweet a message and start a protest in Egypt.
With a mobile phone you can record a song, it will put it up and get famous.
This is all possible with a cell phone.
I'm a <unk> in 1984 and alive in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to that time, to this town.
So here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people are going to look for a change.
This is the fall of 1989. Imagine if all of these people gathered in search for a change, had a mobile phone in your pocket.
Who would have a cell phone here?
<unk>
Raise your mobile phones.
<unk> A Android, a Blackberry, wow!
It's a lot of a cell today.
But today I'm talking about my mobile, and how my life changed me.
I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35 <unk> of information.
<unk> <unk>
Why is that data there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the E.U. Commission presented a <unk>
The <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This directive says that every single telephone company, European company, every single Internet provider -- has to store a wide range of information <unk>
Who calls who. Who sends an email to who.
Who sends a text to <unk>
And if we use the mobile phone, where we are.
This whole information is stored for at least six months, and to two years, in your phone company, or your Internet service.
And in all of Europe people stood up and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this retention of data.
We want <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the phone phone and the suppliers on the Internet -- all this information about us.
There was lawyers, journalists, and everybody said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about 10,000 people who came out to the streets of Berlin and they said, <unk> <unk>
And some of them even said this would be <unk> 2.0.
<unk> was the secret police of Eastern Germany.
And I also wondered if this really works.
Can you store all this information about us?
Every time I use the <unk>
So I asked my phone phone -- <unk> <unk> who then was the biggest phone company in Germany, who would be <unk> all the information you had about me.
I asked them once, and I went back to ask him, and I didn't get a concrete response, it was all blah blah.
But then I said, I want to have this information because you are <unk> my life.
So I decided to take a lawsuit because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said no, we won't give you this information.
At the end of the end, it <unk>
<unk> demand and they sent me the information that I <unk>
Meanwhile, the Veterans' Court <unk> <unk> <unk> for the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly on brown with a CD inside.
And in the CD there was this.
Thirty thousand <unk> <unk> 30 lines of information.
And I saw them and I said, well, it's a huge file, OK.
But after a while, I realized it's my life.
There are six months of my life in this archive.
It was a little bit <unk> what should I do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where the night, what I'm doing.
But then I said, I want this information <unk>
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what the retention of data.
So, along with <unk> <unk> and Open Data City, we did this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom in, and you can go backwards and forward.
You can see every step I read.
And you can see how I go from <unk> on <unk> and how often I call the way.
This is all possible with this information.
That gives a little scary.
But it's not just me.
It's all of us.
First, there are things like, I call my wife and she's called, we talked about a couple of times.
And then they call me some friends and they call me each other.
And then you call the other, and the other one to the other, and we end up with this big communication network.
You can see how their people communicate each other, what time they call each other, what time they go to sleep.
You can see all this.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what the society is.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the shape of your society, because you know who talks to whom, who sent an email to whom, all of this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and to two years.
As I said at first, imagine if all of these people in the streets of Berlin, in the fall of 1989, they had a mobile phone in the pocket.
And the <unk> would have known who I was involved in this protest, and if I knew it, I would have known who the leaders were, this would never have happened.
The fall of the Berlin Wall, probably never happened.
And as a result, not the fall of <unk>
Because today, government agencies and companies want to store so much information from us as it could be inside and outside the web.
They want to have the possibility to follow our lives and they want to be <unk> forever.
But the <unk> and living in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight for the <unk>
You have to fight that every day.
When your friends come home to their friends that privacy is a 21st-century value and it's not just <unk>
When they go home, you will get to your representative that just because companies and state agencies can store some information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, what are you store from you.
So in the future, every time you use your mobile phones to remind you that they have to fight for the <unk> in the digital era.
Thank you.
Hello TEDWomen, what happens?
It's not enough.
Hello TEDWomen, what happens?
My name is <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor that brought me into the world.
<unk> my mom six times in six different directions -- <unk> the poor of me in the process.
As a result, I have cerebral palsy, and that's why I <unk> all the time.
<unk>
It's <unk> I'm like a mixture of <unk>
And Muhammad <unk>
<unk> C. It's not genetics.
It's not <unk> nor can it <unk>
Nobody <unk> the uterus of my mother and not <unk> because my parents were prime cousins, but they are.
It's only about accidents, like the one that occurred to me at birth.
Now, I'm going to tell you, I'm not a source of inspiration. And I don't want any of the present ones.
It feels bad for me, because at some point in life, they wish to be disabled.
We go for a walk.
Christmas <unk> are in the center, drive in circles in search of parking spaces, and what do you see?
16 empty locations for disabled.
And think, "God, I can be at least a little bit <unk>
In addition, I tell you, I have 99 problems, and the P. C. It's just one of them.
There was a <unk> of the <unk> I would win the gold medal.
I'm <unk> Muslim women, disabled and live in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, you might do it.
I'm from Park Park in New Jersey.
I always loved my neighborhood and my disease had the same beginning.
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my home to New York City, I do.
A lot of people with cerebral cerebral palsy, but my parents don't believe that you're unable to.
The mantra of my father was, "You can <unk> <unk> <unk>
If my three older sisters would be <unk> if my three <unk>
If my three older sisters went to public school, my parents went to the school system and <unk> that I was also going to be out of it, and if we didn't take away all the ultimate note -- all the <unk> of my mother.
My father taught me to walk in the age of five and putting my <unk> in his feet and just walking.
Another approach that I used was to hang up a dollar in front of me so that I read it.
The <unk> that I've been inside was very strong and ...
Yes. The first day in kindergarten was walking like a <unk> champion who has gotten a lot of <unk>
Growing up, there was only six Arabs in my city, and they were all of the family.
Now there is 20 Arabic and continue to be all of the family.  I think nobody realized that we weren't <unk>
This was before 9/11, and that the politicians would think appropriate to use <unk> to <unk> as <unk>
The people that I grew up had no problems with my faith.
However, it seemed to be <unk> a lot of hunger that died during the <unk>
I was telling them that I had enough fat to live three whole months without eating three whole months without eating, so dawn at sunset is very easy.
<unk> <unk> in <unk>
Yes, in <unk> It's crazy.  My parents couldn't afford physical therapy, so I was sent to school school.
I learned to <unk> <unk> or whether I can walk with <unk>
I'm from New Jersey, and there we want to be <unk> so if my friends were used <unk> I would too.
And when my friends were going to pass the summer vacation on the coast, I wasn't going.
I spent my summers in a war zone, because my parents were afraid if we weren't going to go back to Palestine -- all the <unk> we were in <unk>
On the summer vacation I often got my father trying to <unk> so I would drink <unk> milk in the back, put me out of the <unk> Sea, and I remember the water <unk> and I remember the water <unk> and I was thinking, <unk> <unk>
But <unk> <unk> was the yoga.
I must say that it's very boring, but before doing yoga was a comedian of <unk> that I couldn't stand <unk> <unk>
And now I can put it in my head.
My parents who were doing this idea that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be at <unk> Hospital.
I went to college through positive discrimination and I got a grant to the <unk> University of the state of Arizona, because I walked into all the <unk>
It was like the mascot of the theater department.
I all <unk>
I did all the work of the least smart, I took the ultimate note in my lectures, and also in their classes.
Every time I was doing a scene of the glass zoo of my <unk>
But I never got a piece of paper.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to make a work called <unk> very slow in Jackson.
It's a piece of a girl with cerebral <unk>
I was a girl with cerebral <unk>
So I started to shout at the four <unk> "When I finally have a <unk>
I have <unk> <unk>
At the end of the end of the end of the end of it.
Thank God <unk> I finally am <unk>
I didn't get the paper.  They gave it to you: Brown.
I went to <unk> running the head of the theater department, crying historically, as if someone would have killed my cat, ask him why and she told me that because they thought I couldn't do the stunt scenes.
And I said, <unk> if I can't do the stunts stunts I can't do the <unk>
It was a paper that literally had been born and gave an actor without cerebral <unk>
I was imitating my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> history of <unk> actors without disability for disabled papers.
At school, I went home, and my first tour tour was as an extra thing in a <unk>
My dream was done.
And I knew it would be <unk> <unk> to <unk> friend <unk> in a <unk>
Instead, it was there as a <unk> I didn't see me more than the <unk> and it was clear to me that the staff of <unk> don't -- no white, with disabilities.
They just <unk> to perfect people.
But there were exceptions to the rule.
I grew up watching <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all these women had one thing in common: they were <unk>
And so I made it <unk>
On my first tour, I took cartoons famous from New York to New Jersey and never forget the face of the first comedian that he took when he fell at high speed by the New Jersey <unk> with a driver that had cerebral <unk>
I worked in clubs and I worked in Arabic in Arabic in the Middle East and without <unk>
Some people say that I'm the first <unk> in the Arab world.
I never really like to reclaim the first place, but I know you never heard that little ugly rumor that said that women are not fun, and they find very fun.
In 2003, my brother and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the <unk> <unk> <unk> in New York, now in his 10.
So our goal was to change the negative image of the <unk> in the media and then remind the directors of <unk> that <unk> and Arabic are not <unk>
<unk> the Arabs were much easier to fight the challenge of <unk>
My big opportunity came in 2010.
I was as invited to the news news program back with Keith <unk>
I walked out as if I was to graduate graduate dance, I went to a study and sat in a wheelchair.
I looked at the director and I said, <unk> can you give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I stood up at the desk of the speaker to not go out of the screen during the <unk> and when I finished the interview, I was <unk>
I finally had my opportunity and I knew it, I knew they wouldn't have me.
But not just Mr. <unk> went back to <unk> but I was walking like the full time and hit my chair.
Something fun that I learned in direct with Keith <unk> was that people on the Internet are <unk>
It is said that kids are <unk> but they never get rid of me and no younger than me.
Suddenly, my disability on the Internet became <unk>
<unk> clips online, "Why <unk>
"It's <unk>
And my favorite <unk> <unk> terrorist.
What disease is that?
We really should be praying for it.
A <unk> suggested even that I would add my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is as visual as race.
If somebody in a wheelchair can't do <unk> then you can't make somebody in the wheelchair.
The disabled are the -- yeah, <unk> man.
<unk> are the biggest minority of the world, and the most <unk> in the world of entertainment.
The doctors said they don't <unk> but I'm here in front of you.
However, there are no media with media, I don't think it <unk>
I hope that together we can create more positive images of disability in the media and in everyday life.
Maybe if there was more positive images, that is less hate on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we need the whole society to teach our children.
My <unk> journey has led me to very spectacular places.
I got to <unk> the red carpet <unk> by the <unk> of <unk> Susan <unk> and the infamous <unk> <unk>
I got to act in a movie with Adam <unk> and to work with my <unk> incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> have become <unk>
I was <unk> in representation of the great state of New Jersey in the <unk> of 2008.
And I started <unk>
It was the only time my father saw me live alive, and I do this talk to his memory.
<unk> in peace, <unk>
My name is <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can also can.
I'd like to tell you a story about a kid from a young people.
I don't know his name, but I know his story.
She lives in a little town to the South <unk>
This people are near <unk>
<unk> drives small people to poverty and on the edge of the <unk>
Without anything for him there, it goes to the great city, in this case, <unk> the capital.
When it comes there, there are no opportunities, there's no job, no perspectives of future.
He just lived in a tent in the city outside of <unk>
After maybe a year of <unk> nothing.
One day on a guy who offers him to <unk> him after dinner, <unk>
He meets a dynamic group of people, which gives you a break.
She gets a little bit of money to buy new, money to send home, to his family.
They present to a young guy.
He finally went home.
It starts a new life.
It has a life.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky, bursts a car bomb.
That little boy in that little village with the dreams of the great city, was the terrorist terrorist and that dynamic group of people were at <unk> a terrorist organization with al Qaeda.
So how a story of a small village of a small village trying to fulfill their dreams in the city ends with him <unk>
He was waiting.
I was waiting for an opportunity, hoping to start her future, waiting for a future perspective, and this was the first thing that gave it.
This was the first thing that he pulled it out of what we call "the <unk> period.
And his story is repeated in urban centers around the world.
It's the story of the <unk> young urban <unk> who <unk> riots in <unk> riots in London, who are looking for something beyond <unk> in <unk>
For the young people, the promise of the city, the great dream of the city is the opportunity for jobs, but the young people don't engage in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often the youth that suffer from the highest unemployment.
By 2030, three of every five people living in cities will be under 18 years.
If we don't include the young people in the growth of our cities, if they don't give them -- opportunities -- the history of <unk> <unk> the door of access to terrorism, to violence, to be the story of cities 2.0.
And in my city of birth, 70 percent of the young people are <unk>
70 percent don't work at school.
They don't do anything.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit the <unk> Hospital, where I was born.
I remember standing in front of that hospital at <unk> thinking, and if I'd never had gone?
And if I had seen me forced to be in that same <unk> <unk>
I would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure about the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to harbor a few juvenile leaders at a business Pacific.
They went to about 90 youth leaders.
We sat down and we had an rain of ideas about solutions to the great challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He went to the University of <unk> <unk>
There was no job, no opportunity.
I remember when he told me, that because I was a graduate graduate university university, I was the perfect white for Al <unk> and other organizations, to be <unk>
They were looking for people like him.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the biggest obstacle to coming from point A to B is the streets.
<unk> years of civil war have completely destroyed the traffic system, and a motorcycle can be the easiest way to <unk>
<unk> saw an opportunity and <unk>
He started a <unk> company.
He started <unk> headed to local residents who would normally not be able to afford them.
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of his family and friends, and his dream is at some point to expand hundreds of <unk> over the next three years.
Why is this story?
What does this different story do?
I think their ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's the corporate spirit and I believe that business business can be the most powerful tool against <unk>
<unk> young people to be the creators of the economic opportunities that are looking for so hard.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
I was <unk> to train some of the young people in the senior business fund and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of business progress.
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen in over 22 years, and until Mohamed arrived, if you wanted flowers for your <unk> <unk> we were from plastic from the way from abroad.
If you ask someone, "When was the last time you saw flowers <unk>
For those of you who grew up during civil war, the answer would be <unk>
So, Mohamed saw an opportunity.
It started a company of <unk> and design.
I created a farm outside <unk> and he started growing <unk> and <unk> who said, they could survive the hard climate of <unk>
And he started the delivery of flowers for family, creating gardens in the houses, and the city companies -- and now it's working on the creation of the world's first public park in 22 years.
There are no public parks in <unk>
She wants to create a space where the young families, the young families, you can go together, and like he says, smell the pink <unk>
By the way, he's not <unk> pink because they use a lot of water.
So the first step is to inspire young people, and in that room, the presence of Mohamed had a really profound impact on the young.
They had never thought about starting a business.
They had thought about working for an NGO working for the government, but their history, it really had a strong impact on them.
It forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity.
<unk> to believe that they might be entrepreneurs, that they might be <unk> of change.
By the end of the day, they had innovative solutions to some of the biggest challenges facing the city.
<unk> business solutions for local problems.
So, inspiring young people and creating a culture of business is really a big step, but the young people need capital to make their ideas happen.
They need expertise and guidance to <unk> in development and set them out of their businesses.
We hired young people with the resources that they need, to give us the support that they need to move from conception to creation, and create a lot for urban growth.
For me, the entrepreneurial spirit is something else to start a business.
It's to create social impact.
Mohamed is not just selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
His Park.
I was hired to hired the street to help rent and keep the <unk> for him.
He gave them the opportunity to escape the <unk> of <unk>
These young men are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is, to become young people in entrepreneurs, <unk> and eating their innovation and they will have more stories about flowers and Parks of the Peace <unk> that <unk> and <unk> of <unk>
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old, and I went to <unk> with my dad in the <unk> <unk> an area <unk> in upstate New York City.
It was a beautiful day.
The forest <unk>
The sun made the leaves <unk> like a <unk> and not the way that we could almost pretend that we were able to pretend we were the first human beings to step on that ground.
We got to our camp.
It was a shed in a <unk> with a beautiful lake Lake <unk> when I discovered something horrible.
Behind the shed there was a <unk> of about four square feet with apple apple <unk> balls of paper <unk> and <unk>
And I was <unk> I was very angry and incredibly <unk>
The <unk> who were too lazy as to pull out what they thought was going to clean their <unk>
That question followed me, and it was <unk> a little bit.
Who clean our <unk>
No matter how <unk> or where do you look at it, who clean our trash in <unk>
Who clean our trash in Rio or Paris or <unk>
Here in New York, the <unk> Department of clean our trash, of course, about 11 billion tons of waste and two tons of <unk> every day.
I wanted to know as individuals.
I wanted to understand who does that work.
What does it feel like to use the uniform and take that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled in the trucks and I walked through his labs, and I interviewed people in office and facilities in the entire city, and I learned a lot, but it was still a <unk>
I needed to get more.
So I started working as <unk>
Now not just traveling in the trucks. I was the <unk>
And operated with <unk> mechanical <unk> and <unk>
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
Everybody wonders about smell.
It's there, but it's not as prevailing as you believe, and in the days that it's very strong one is rapidly <unk>
It costs a lot of used to weight.
I met people who had worked on that for several years, and their bodies were still getting up to the weight of taking over their body tons of garbage every weeks.
It's also the danger.
According to the Office <unk> <unk> the collection of waste is one of the most dangerous <unk> in the country, and I learned the reason.
You're coming out and entering traffic all day and pass around around you.
They just want to say, so the driver is not paying attention.
That's very bad for the <unk>
And the crap itself is filled with dangers that often fall off the truck and cause terrible damage.
I also learned about the relentless trash.
When you get out of the <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that garbage is as a force of nature itself.
It never keeps coming.
It's also like a kind of breathing or circulation.
It's always to be movement.
And it's also stigma.
It seems to me that stigma is especially ironic because I believe that the waste of waste is the most important labor in the streets of the city, for three reasons.
They're the first <unk> of public health.
If you don't get rid of the waste and efficient form every day, it starts to distract them from their containers and their dangers inherent to protect us in very real forms.
And we have the technology that we had controlled for decades, and centuries come back and start <unk>
The economy needs it.
If we can't get rid of the old one, we don't have space for what the engines of the economy begin to fail when it's endangered when it's <unk>
I'm not advocating for capitalism, I just pointing your relationship.
And then it's what I call our average <unk> we need it.
So what I mean by that is just at the speed of what used to move in the short time.
We don't usually care about it, and we didn't stop or cleaned up with us our cup of coffee, our bag of <unk> our water bottle.
We use it, the <unk> we forget about them, because we know that there's a job force on the other side that it takes for it.
So today, I want to suggest to you a couple of ways to think about the collection of waste that maybe help to reduce the stigma and focus on that conversation about how to design a sustainable and human city.
His work, I think, is almost <unk>
They're on the street every day, <unk>
They use a uniform in many cities.
You know when they were <unk>
And their work allows us to do ours.
It's almost a way of relief.
The flow that keeps us safely from ourselves, our own <unk> our <unk> and that flow should always stay in one way or another.
One day after September 11, 2001, I heard the <unk> of a garbage collection truck on the street, grabbed my little son, she went down the stairs and he went down the stairs and he was running the stairs <unk> and there was a man doing her journey <unk>
And I tried to thank his job that day in particular, but I started crying.
And he looked at me and he looked at me and said, "We're going to be fine.
We're going to be right."
Shortly after that, I started looking at the garbage collection and I went back to see that man.
It's called <unk> we worked together a lot of times and we got good friends.
I want to believe I was right.
We're going to be fine.
But in our efforts to <unk> the way we exist on this planet as a species we should include and having to account all the costs, even the very real human cost of the labor.
The city waste is what we think about trash, represent three percent of the amount of waste in the nation.
It's a remarkable <unk>
So in the flow of your days and their lives, the next thing to look at somebody whose job is to clean up the garbage of you, let's take a moment to <unk>
So let's take a moment to tell you so much.
My work focuses on the connection of thinking about our communal life to be part of the environment where architecture is naturally occurring in the conditions and local traditions.
I brought two recent projects like this.
Both projects are located in the emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
They also share the fact that the different analysis from different perspectives become an essential part of the end of architecture.
The first example began with an invitation to design a commercial center of several stories in the capital of Ethiopia, Addis Ababa <unk>
This is the kind of construction that showed us as an example of my team and me, about what we had to design.
At first, the first thing I thought was, "I want to go out <unk>
After seeing some of these buildings there are a lot of the city, we realized that there are three important aspects to <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores where people can't afford to buy things.
Second, you need to employ a lot of energy because the coating of crystals generates heat in the interior, so you need a lot of <unk>
In a city that this shouldn't happen because it is a temperate climate that goes from 20 to 25 degrees during every year.
And third, what does nothing do to do with Africa nor with Ethiopia.
It's one worth of being so rich in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, I was really enchanted with the old market that is this structure in the open air, where thousands of people, go and buy things every day to little <unk>
There is also that idea of using public space to generate external activity.
So I thought, that that was what I really wanted to design, not a mall.
But the question was how to build a building, of several stories, applying these principles.
The next challenge was introduced to the site of the site, which is located in a lot of growth in the city, where a lot of the buildings that we now see in the picture, not exist.
And it's also among two streets parallel that they don't communicate in an extension of hundreds of feet.
So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets, put all the inputs from the building.
And this extends with a <unk> <unk> that creates an outdoor outdoor space in the building that would be characterized by its own shape, the sun and the rain.
And around this space we have applied the idea of the market with small businesses, that changes in every floor because of the space form.
I also thought, how to close the building?
I wanted to figure out a solution that we would go to local climate conditions.
And I started thinking about a similar tissue to a concrete <unk> <unk> to allow the air entry and also of the light, but in a <unk> way.
Then we were inspired by these beautiful buttons in the dresses of the <unk>
They have properties of the fractal geometry, and this helped me to model the <unk>
We are building that with these little <unk> pieces that are the windows that leave the air and light in a way floating inside of the building.
This is <unk> with these little colors of colors that use the interior of the building to illuminate the building at night.
With these ideas that were not easy to convince developers because they thought, "That's not a commercial center.
But ultimately we all realized that this idea of the market was to be much more profitable than the business center.
And then the idea of the facade was much more economic -- not just because of the material compared to glass, but also because it didn't need to have air conditioning.
So we get certain savings in the budget that we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to achieve the energy <unk> for the building in a city where the electricity goes up almost every day.
So we got a big advantage by putting <unk> on the roof.
And then under those panels we think of the roof as a new public space with areas of meeting and bars that would create this <unk> <unk>
And these <unk> on the roof, which they have set up water for the <unk>
It's expected for the beginning of the next year, because we're going through the fifth floor floor.
The second example is a master plan of 2,000 apartments and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to make a project so big, the biggest that I have designed, I needed not just to understand the city of Tunisia, but also its environment, their tradition and culture.
During that analysis, I put special attention in the <unk> a <unk> structure that was surrounded by a wall with twelve doors connected by nearly straight lines.
When I went to place, the first design operation that we did was to expand the streets in existing streets, creating 12 similar blocks in size and features in Barcelona and other cities of Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we select some of the strategic dots in relation to the idea of the <unk> doors with straight lines, and this changed the initial model.
And the last operation was to think of the cell, the small cell in the project, like the apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would be the best orientation for an apartment in the <unk>
And it's <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and therefore natural ventilation, a natural ventilation.
So let's make a scheme that claims that most apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that it's almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with <unk> and then in the low plant we have all the connections to the pedestrians.
And it also responds to local norms that set up a greater density in higher levels and lower density in the plant low.
And it also reinforces this idea of the doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost as much as giving the community busy occupied by construction.
It's where all the neighbors, can go up and make activities such as running a <unk> race race in the morning, or jump from one building to another building.
These two examples, have a common approach in the design process.
And also, they're in the emerging countries, where you can see cities literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in the life of people changes communities and local economies at the same rate that grow buildings.
For this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture looking for simple solutions, but <unk> that improve the relationship between the community and the environment and that they have as a goal connecting nature with people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new girl joined our class. It was as remarkable, as you see all the new girls.
I had lots of very bright hair <unk> and a little pink <unk> <unk> It was super strong for the capitals of the states, very good for <unk>
I ended up that year, and I was full of jealousy, until I was filled with my sinister plan.
One day I stayed in time after the exit of school, I was a little afternoon and I hid in the bathroom of the girls.
When the coast was <unk> salt, I went into the classroom, I took off the table of my teacher to the ratings of grades.
And then I did.
I took the ratings in my <unk> just a little bit, just a few moments.
All the Like --  And I set up to bring the book back to the <unk> but see, some of my other colleagues had very good notes as well.
So in a <unk> <unk> the notes around the world, without any imagination.
And I put all of them in front of them, and myself a row of so just for being there, because I'm going to be there.
I'm still surprised what I did.
I don't understand how the idea.
I don't understand why I felt good at doing it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I never <unk>
It's that everything was <unk>
I never <unk>
But most of all, I was telling me the reason why I was told that this little girl was so small, was so good for <unk>
I ignored jealousy.
They're so <unk> and so <unk>
We know that babies suffer from jealousy.
Also, the birds <unk> <unk> are very <unk>
We know that the <unk> are the number one cause of spouses in the U.S.
And yet, I've never seen a study that would be <unk> or the long duration or the sadness.
So you have to go to the fiction, because novels are like the lab that you study the <unk> in all of their possible forms.
In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say that if there were no biblical jealousy, there would be literature.
Well there would be no <unk> the <unk> no <unk>
There would be no <unk> king and <unk>
There was no Shakespeare.
<unk> the high school lists of high school, because we would be losing "The <unk> and the <unk> would not have <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Without jealousy, there's no <unk> I know it's fashionable to say that <unk> has the answers for everything, and in terms of the jealousy, most of them have all of them.
This year is being used to be 100 years of his work -- "In the pursuit of the time, the most <unk> study of sexual <unk> and also the ordinary <unk> of mine, all we could have.
We think about a child trying to reconcile sleep.
We think about a <unk> <unk> in <unk>
We forgot how hard that image.
We forgot how relentless it is.
I mean, this is books that Virginia <unk> said were as hard as <unk> <unk>
I don't know how the cat, <unk> but we assume it's <unk>
Let's see why they're so well together, the novel and the <unk> the <unk> and <unk>
It's going to be very obvious as the jealousy, that are reduced to the person, to their desire, to their <unk> are a well-known narrative <unk>
I don't know. I think we get very close to the bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel jealousy, we tell ourselves a story.
A story about the lives of other people, and those stories make us feel terrible, because they're designed for that, to make us feel bad.
Being <unk> and audience, we know exactly what detail you would like to <unk> the knife, right?
<unk> make us all novelists <unk> and that's something that we <unk> understand.
All she does for me to give me pleasure could make pleasure right now.
And it starts to say to himself that story, and since then, <unk> says that every genuine fresh charm that he <unk> detects in his lover, he adds up to his collection of instruments of torture in his private camera.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, <unk> <unk> would have to abandon the country, if they wanted to break up with it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's hard work. Right?
<unk> are <unk>
It's an emotional <unk> You have to <unk>
And how are the <unk>
The <unk> <unk> of information.
<unk> use the details.
<unk> like the large quantities of bright hair and cute little <unk> <unk>
The <unk> <unk> in the photos.
This is why Instagram is so successful --  <unk> links well to the language of jealousy.
When <unk> is in his <unk> agony of course, listening behind the gates and <unk> the <unk> of his lover -- then defending those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you think this is <unk> but it's not different from your interpretation of an old text or looking at a <unk>
He says, "It's a scientific research with real value.
<unk> is trying to prove that the <unk> look <unk> and they make us seem to be <unk> but in their <unk> they are search for knowledge, search for the truth, a really painful truth, in fact, what to do -- you know, the more <unk> the truth is better.
The pain, the <unk> the <unk> These were the <unk>
He says, "A woman who we need to do is, that makes us hope -- causes us a much deeper range of feelings and vital that a wise man that can help us.
It is telling us that we're going to look for women.
No. I think it's trying to say that the <unk> will reveal ourselves.
And there is some other excitement that makes us <unk> in this particular way.
Is there any other excitement to us, our <unk> our horrible ambition and our <unk>
Some other excitement that teaches us to look at very <unk>
Freud would write about this later.
One day, Freud was visited by a young young man who was being consumed with the idea that his woman would get it.
And Freud said that there was something weird in that guy, who didn't fall into what his wife.
Well, she was <unk> everybody knew it.
The poor creature was under suspicion without any cause.
But he was looking for things that made his wife, without realizing it <unk> behaviors.
<unk> <unk> or even accidentally accidentally <unk>
Freud said that the man was becoming the <unk> of his wife.
<unk> are very good at this.
<unk> describe very well how the <unk> do to look at the intensity but <unk>
In fact, the more intensely <unk> we are, more we become <unk>
And for this reason, I think, <unk> lead us to violent or illegal <unk>
<unk> drive us to behave in ways completely <unk>
Now I'm thinking about my case when I was eight years old, but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard in the news.
A woman from Michigan for 52 years was captured by having created a false account on Facebook from which he was sent to be messages to send himself terrible messages for itself, for a year.
For one year, every year.
She was trying to <unk> the new girlfriend of his former boyfriend. I have to confess that when or this, I reacted with <unk>
Because, let's be realistic.
How big -- even if you're creativity. Right?
It's like <unk>
Like a novel from Patricia <unk>
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange and brilliant character in the American literature.
It's the author of <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> Mr. <unk> books that are trying to how the icons <unk> our minds, and once we're in the sphere, in the kingdom of the jealousy, the membrane that separates what it might be, can be <unk> in a second.
Take his most famous character.
Tom <unk> is going to be <unk> or want what you have to invade your self and take care of what you ever <unk> and it's under the floor <unk> your name, takes your rings, empty your bank accounts.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the route of Tom <unk>
I can't give you the whole world, as much as I wanted to.
It's a shame, because we live in times of envy.
We live in times of jealousy.
I mean, we are good citizens of social networks, where the currency is <unk> right?
<unk> tell us the <unk> I'm not sure.
So we're going to do what the characters are always doing when they're not sure, when they're in a mystery.
Let's go to the Baker Street <unk> and ask for <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> they think about <unk> <unk> in Professor <unk> that criminal genius.
But I've always said, <unk> <unk> <unk> the head of <unk> rat <unk> who needs <unk> <unk> needs the genius of <unk> but it bothers it.
Oh, it sounds so <unk>
<unk> needs its help, but it <unk> and <unk> with <unk> in each of those mysteries.
But as they work together, something starts changing, and finally in "The <unk> of the Six <unk> once you <unk> it <unk> to all of them with their solution, <unk> <unk> and says, "We're not <unk> Mr. <unk>
We are proud of <unk>
And he says that there's no person in <unk> <unk> who wouldn't want to hold your hand.
It's one of the times that we see <unk> relocated in history. It seems to me very emotional -- that scene is also mysterious, right?
It seems to treat <unk> as a problem of geometry, without excitement.
You know, in a minute <unk> it's the opposite side of <unk>
The next minute are the same side.
Suddenly, <unk> allows you to admire that idea of being the <unk>
It may still be so simple?
What if the <unk> are really a matter of geometry, just a question of where we allowed us to be in relation to another?
Well, maybe we don't have to stop the excellence of the other.
We can do it with it.
But I like <unk> plans.
So while we hope that happens, we remember we have fiction to <unk>
There's only fiction that jealousy.
fiction used to <unk> invites them to the table.
And look at the <unk> sweet <unk> the scary Tom <unk> the mad <unk> the very Marcel Marcel <unk>
We're in great company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
On the 21st of July 1969, Buzz Aldrin jumped out of the module.
Armstrong and Aldrin were alone, but their presence in the surface of the world is the culmination of a collective process of <unk>
The Apollo program was the largest decline in days of peace in American history.
To get to the moon, NASA spent about 180 billion dollars of day today, or four percent of the federal budget today.
The Apollo took about 400,000 people and asked the collaboration 20,000 companies, universities and government agencies.
They died, including the crew of Apollo 1.
But before the Apollo program <unk> 24 men went to the moon.
<unk> walked on his surface, which came up after the death of Armstrong last year, is now the most <unk>
So why do you <unk>
They didn't get a lot of <unk> <unk> kilos of old rocks, and something that 24 <unk> later, a new sense of <unk> and the fragility of our common home.
Why <unk> The cynical answer is that they were because President Kennedy wanted to demonstrate the <unk> that this nation was better rockets.
But the word of Kennedy at Rice University in <unk> give us a better idea.
John F. <unk> Some questions why <unk>
Why turn it to turn on our goal?
And you might also ask, why scale up the top mountain <unk>
35 years ago, why fly on the <unk>
Why does Rice play Rice <unk>
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're difficult.
Jason <unk> For the <unk> the Apollo wasn't just a victory of the West about this in the Cold War.
At the time, the strongest emotion was <unk> to the transcendence of the powers of technology.
It was because it was something great to be able to do it.
The landing on the moon happened in a context of a long list of technological courage.
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the plane, penicillin and the vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, it was <unk> and all the age of smallpox.
Technology seemed to own what Alvin <unk> in 1970, called <unk> <unk>
For most of the history of humanity, we couldn't go faster than a horse or a horse and a candle ship, but in 1969, the crew of Apollo 10 flew at 40,000 miles per hour.
Since 1970, no human being has gone back to the moon.
No one has gone faster than crew of Apollo 10, and the optimism of optimism about the power of technology has been <unk> when we see the problems that we would solve as going to Mars, create a clean energy, curing cancer, or feed the world population seem to be <unk>
I remember watching Apollo <unk>
I was five years old, and my mother told me that I didn't get the <unk> tube of the rocket Saturn <unk>
I knew that this would be the last <unk> mission, but I was completely sure that I would get to see colonies on Mars.
So that came to our ability to solve the problems with the <unk> it's become a common place.
We hear it all the time.
We've heard it over the last two days here, at TED.
It looks like the technologists would have <unk> and they have enriched with trivial toys, things like <unk> applications and social networks, or algorithms that speed up <unk>
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They have expanded and enriched our lives.
But we don't know the great problems of humanity.
What happened?
There's an explanation in the Silicon Valley in Silicon Valley, that we have created a less ambitious companies than <unk> from the years in which we were at least <unk> Microsoft, Apple and <unk>
Silicon Valley says that markets are the guilty, specifically the incentives that venture capitalists provide entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that the risk of risk caused us to create ideas of ideas that are governed by funding problems, or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
<unk> mostly what's wrong in Mathare Valley.
Even when the venture capitalists were at their high point without worrying about the risk, they preferred small investment, more than they could go out in 10 years.
<unk> have always had trouble to invest in technologies as energy, that they need a huge capital and whose development is in the long term.
No, the reasons why we can't solve big problems are more complicated and profound.
Sometimes, we choose not to solve the big problems.
Could we go to Mars if you look at it.
NASA has even designed a plan.
But going to Mars would require a political decision that was popular, and that will never happen.
We're not going to go to Mars because everyone thinks there are more important things to do on Earth.
Sometimes, we can't solve the big problems, because political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of global energy consumption comes from energy sources as solar and solar and <unk> Less than two percent, and the reason is completely cheap.
The coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind, and oil is cheaper than <unk>
We want sources of alternative energy that can compete in price <unk>
Now, technologists, entrepreneurs and economists agree about what policies and international treaties with the development of <unk> energy, a significant increase in research and development development and some kind of control of the price of coal.
But there is no hope in the political climate that we will see an American government policy or international treaties that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes, the big problems that seemed technological, they have not be.
We know for the time that famines are a result of failure on food work.
But 30 years of research has taught us that famines are policies that affect <unk> the distribution of food.
Technology can improve things like harvest or systems for the storage and food system -- but there will be famines while there were bad governments.
Finally, the big problems sometimes <unk> a solution because we don't understand the problem.
The president CEO read the war to cancer in 1971, but soon we discovered that there are many types of cancer, some terribly resistant to treatment, and only in the last 10 years, seem to have found effective treatments and viable.
The hard problems are hard.
It's not true that we can't solve the problems with technology.
We can and we should, but these four elements have been <unk> and the political leaders and the population must want to solve the problem, the institutions have to support the <unk> it must be really about a <unk> problem, and we need to understand it.
The <unk> mission that has become something like a metaphor for the ability of technology to solve big problems, it serves with those criteria.
But it's a model of <unk> in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There's no <unk> competition like the Cold War, there is no politician like John Kennedy that <unk> the hard and dangerous, and there's no science fiction mythology like the exploring solar system.
In general, go to the moon turned out to be simple.
It was just three days.
And really, I wasn't even <unk> no problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be more difficult to get.
God knows that we don't miss the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to begin with the ideas that have been <unk>
They're so common that they've become <unk> of our society.
I think they're three.
The first one is a <unk> there's been a huge decline of trust, it's a very severe belief.
The second is a goal: we should have more confidence.
And the third is a <unk> we should recover trust.
I think the <unk> the goal and the task has been <unk>
What I'm going to try and tell you today is a different story about a <unk> an objective and a task, which I think gives you a more clear idea about it.
First, why do people think that trust has <unk>
And if I think about the basis of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
And he bow to thinking that there may be down in some activities or institutions and that could have increased in others.
I don't have the clear.
But I can turn to <unk> polls and opinion polls are supposedly the source of the belief that the confidence has decreased.
When you look at public opinion polls over time, there's no many evidence of it.
I mean, the people who were <unk> 20 years ago, mainly journalists and politicians, continue to <unk> the same <unk>
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years ago still being pretty <unk> the judges who were quite reliable at the time.
The rest of us are in the middle, and by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost exactly half of the road.
But is this evidence for enough?
What the opinion opinion polls are, of course, opinions.
What else can you get?
So what you look at is the <unk> attitudes that people are getting certain questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if someone will tell you, <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk>
It's probably going to be asking, "What for?"
And that would be a very intriguing response.
And you could say, when you have answered your question, "Well, I trust some, but in other no."
Which is very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to deposit trust in <unk>
We don't assume that the level of confidence that we're going to feel by a certain kind of <unk> and a guy or a person, it's going to be a uniform in all cases.
I could, for example, say I trust a certain elementary teacher that I know to give up reading, but no way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good <unk>
I could trust my wildest friend to keep a conversation, but not, perhaps, to keep a secret.
Simple.
And if we've got those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is <unk> why we stop all of that knowledge when we think about trust in the most <unk>
I believe that surveys are very bad tools to measure the true level of real trust, because they're trying to get the good judgment to the fact of trust in something or somebody.
Second, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more trust.
Frankly, I think it's a stupid.
This is not the goal that I would have.
I would encourage you to have more confidence in what is <unk> of trust, but not what it isn't.
Ultimately, I'm <unk> not to trust what is not reliable.
And I think that those people who <unk> their savings with the very <unk> named Mr. <unk> who then disappeared with them, I think about them, and I think, well, yes, they were too <unk>
Having more confidence is not a smart objective in this life.
They were deposited or <unk> with intelligence, that's the right target.
Once you say, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that means that what matters first is not trust, but trustworthiness.
And what it is is about making a judgment of how reliable people are in certain ways.
And I think that we can do a trial, we are forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if you find that one person is <unk> in the <unk> subjects and it's responsible and honest, then we'll have a very good reason to trust it, because it's going to be <unk>
But if, in the contrary, it's not accountable, we couldn't trust them.
I have friends who are <unk> and honest, but I don't have a letter to the <unk> because they're <unk>
I have friends that are very confident that you can do certain things, but I see that I can make your own <unk>
And I'm happy to say that I don't have a lot of friends who are <unk> and responsible but extremely <unk>
If it's like this, I still haven't <unk>
But that's what we are <unk> <unk> before we trust.
<unk> is the answer.
<unk> is what we need to be <unk>
And of course, it's hard.
In the last decades, we've tried to build systems of accountability for all sorts of institutions, professional officials and others, that make us easier to judge their reliability.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work like <unk>
I remember once I was talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, you'll see the problem is that it takes more time to make the administrative <unk> than attend <unk>
And we found the same problem in all of our public lives, and we would argue that the system of accountability which is destined to ensure that we are going to guarantee the <unk> and testing tests actually is doing the opposite.
What they do is they <unk> the work of the people who have to do hard tasks, like the <unk> <unk> that <unk> the <unk> as we say.
You've got to all know a similar examples.
And we put all of that, by the target.
I think the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different if we were being worthy of being worthy of being worthy of trust and <unk> to the people who are reliable and whether we try to determine whether other people, officials or politicians are worthy of trust.
It's not easy. It's the trial, simple action, the <unk> what you don't do properly.
Third, the task.
<unk> the task to rebuild the trust, it puts things backwards.
It suggests that you and I should rebuild trust.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
Can we rebuild a little trustworthiness.
We can do it if they're two people, together, trying to improve trust.
But confidence is <unk> because we give us other people.
You can't reconstruct what other people have given you.
You have to give you enough bases so you can trust you.
You have to be worthy of trust.
And that, of course, is because you can't <unk> by all people, all the time.
But you also have to bring <unk> evidence that you're worthy of trust.
How do you do it?
That is every day, everywhere, the common people, the <unk> the institutions, very effectively.
I'll give you a simple commercial example.
The shop where I buy my socks on says I can <unk> without a explanations for.
I take care of them and get my money back, or they change it by the color that I want.
That's great. I trust them because they became vulnerable to me.
I think there's a great lesson on that.
If you become vulnerable to the other hand, that's a very good test that you're worthy of trust and you have confidence in what you're saying.
So in the end, I think what we're pointing is not a very difficult thing to get.
What people rely on is relationships, and in that framework, they can determine when the other person is worthy of trust.
Thank you.
Since the early computers we have come <unk> to reduce the separation between us and digital information, the separation between our material world, and the world of the screen in which the imagination can be <unk>
This separation has gone and become more and more and more, at a point that today is less than one millimeter, the thickness of a <unk> screen, and the power of computing has become accessible to everyone.
But I ask myself to myself, and if I had no <unk>
I started to imagine how to <unk>
First I created this tool that gets confused in the digital space, so that when the strong <unk> against the screen is that your physical body <unk>
Designers can take their ideas directly into 3D, and surgeons can practice with virtual organs below the screen.
So with this tool, the barriers.
But the two hands still remain outside of the screen.
How do we get inside and interact with digital information using the entire skill of the hands?
In the division of Science <unk> from Microsoft, along with my mentor <unk> <unk> <unk> the computer and turned a small space on the keyboard in a <unk> digital area of work.
It was going to be a transparent bombsight with depth cameras deep in order to detect your fingers and their face, you can now raise your hands of the keyboard, you get to the inside of the 3D space, and grab pixels directly with your hands.
Like windows and archives have a location in real space, it's as easy to grab a book of a <unk>
You can flip through the book and pull it out lines or words with the virtual touch sensor that is below every floating screen.
Architects can stretch their models directly with your hands.
In these examples, we were <unk> in the digital world.
And if we invest the papers and we make digital information come towards us?
We had a lot of us we will have bought and spend things on the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry about.
What I have here is a virtual <unk> on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a device on your head or <unk> when the system gets the geometry of your body.
If we take this idea further, I thought, instead of just seeing pixels in space, how can we make physicists so we can make it <unk> and <unk>
How would a future like this?
At the MIT Media Lab with my <unk> Hiroshi Ishii, and my collaborator <unk> Post, this only <unk>
This magnet <unk> behaves like a 3D pixel in space, which means that both the computer like users can move the object anywhere inside this little three-dimensional space in this little three-dimensional space.
<unk> what we did was we <unk> gravity and control motion through a combination of levitation and <unk> <unk> mechanical <unk>
And in programming the object, we release it from the restrictions of time and space, which means that human movements can <unk> and come back to reproduce and stay in the physical world.
You can teach them physically and physically distance and the famous shot of Michael Jordan, you can reproduce it as a physics reality sometimes that we want.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the movement of planets, the physics, and unlike the monitors or textbooks, this is a real and palpable experience that you can touch and feel.
But what's more fascinating than changing the physics of the computer is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our everyday physical activities.
As you can see, digital information will not just show us something but to start acting directly about ourselves as a part of the physical world around us that surrounds us without having to take away from our world.
So we started talking about a barrier, but if you take that barrier, the only limit that is left is our imagination.
Thank you.
I was excited to become <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the 1950s.
When I was in first grade, the government wanted to join a school to athletes with all expenses paid.
But my tiger mother, "No."
My parents wanted to become engineering, like them.
After survive the Islamic Revolution -- they create strongly that there was just an immediate path to <unk> a safe job and <unk>
Whatever I want or not.
But my dream was to be an opera singer <unk>
This was me, in my piano.
An opera singer has to start <unk> from very young to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could go to the opera school.
I even wrote to the director of school and the host of a radio show.
But no adult would take the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
Only my friends were <unk> but they were kids, without authority, like me.
So at age 15, I knew it was too much more to train.
My dream is never <unk>
<unk> that during the rest of my life a <unk> happiness was the only thing to aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I decided to look for another <unk>
No one around me wanted to <unk> Okay.
I went to books.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> My <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in 1995, and what the first books were here?
The ones that were <unk> in China, of course.
"The Good <unk> is about Chinese <unk> life.
And it's not a secret <unk>
The Bible is interesting, but weird.
That's a theme for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a <unk> <unk> to your father and your mother."
<unk> I said, "It's so different, and so much better than <unk>
So it became my tool to get out of this <unk> <unk> and to reset the relationship with my parents.
I find it with a new culture also led to my habit of reading <unk>
And so many perspectives.
For example, this map seemed to me out of place because this is what students in China learn.
I had never occurred, that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves the perspective of people.
Green reading is not something new.
It's common practice in the academic world.
There are to research fields like comparative religion and comparative literature.
<unk> and <unk> offers academics a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought that if the comparative reading worked for research, why not do it in life as well.
So I started reading books from two.
You can be able to go from <unk> <unk> from Walter <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who were involved in a <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
For <unk> <unk> are economic cheap, political and spiritual.
For Buddha, they are all <unk> lust, fear and <unk>
If you know other language, it's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages.
<unk> <unk> <unk> Thomas <unk> <unk> <unk>
For example, it's through the translation that I realized that <unk> in Chinese literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, literally means <unk> mother."
The books opened up a magic door to connect with people from the past and the present.
I know I'm not going to feel I used or <unk> never.
Having a broken dream -- it's really nothing compared to what many others have <unk>
I've come to believe that writing is not the only purpose of a dream.
Their most important purpose is to connect to the place that the dreams come from, where the passion, where the passion comes from.
Even a broken dream can do that.
And that's because of the books, I'm here, happy, living again with purpose and clearly, most of the time.
So the books always <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first customer <unk>
I was a Ph.D. student in clinical Berkeley.
She was a year-old woman named <unk>
Alex walked into the first session using jeans and a <unk> stumbled into my office and took away the shoes and told me that I wanted to talk about their problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My roommate had a <unk> like the first client.
And I had a <unk> I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could handle it.
But I didn't.
With the <unk> stories that Alex brought to the <unk> it made me easy to move the head while I was doing the solution.
"The <unk> are the new <unk> he said Alex, and so I looked at, she was right.
You start working on, then you get home later, it has children later, until death goes on.
For <unk> as Alex and I had plenty of time.
But soon after, my <unk> pushed me to press Alex I would talk about your life <unk>
I <unk>
I said, "Yes, it's coming up with guys under his category, <unk> with a <unk> head, but it's not as if it was to marry him."
And then my squad <unk> said, <unk> but maybe <unk> with the next.
Also, the best time to work in the marriage of Alex is before it was <unk>
This is what psychologists call a moment.
It was when I realized that the <unk> are not the new <unk>
Yes, people sit on the head of what they were doing, but this didn't make the <unk> of Alex a pause in their development.
This made the <unk> of Alex were the perfect moment and we were <unk>
And then I realized, that this kind of recklessness was a real problem and had real consequences, not only for Alex and his life life, but for the careers, the families and the future of <unk> all over the place.
There's 50 million <unk> in the United States, today.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent -- if you think no one comes to adulthood without going to happen before the <unk>
Raise your hand if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk> here.
Oh, Yes! They're amazing.
If you work with <unk> they love a <unk> you take your dream away from a <unk> I want to see. All right. <unk> the <unk> really matter.
This is not just my view, this is the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will happen at the age of 35 years.
This means that eight of every 10 decisions and experiences and experiences and moments that shape their life will have happened for when you have 30 and <unk>
People from more than 40, I don't go to panic.
This audience is going to be good, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a race have an exponential impact on the amount of money that we can make.
We know that more than half of Americans are married, or they're coming out with their future partner at 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up its second and last phase of growth in its <unk> and <unk> to <unk> which means that if there's something that you want to change out of yourself, now it's time to change it.
We know that the personality changes more times during its <unk> than at any other time of life, and we know that female fertility comes to its top to 28 and things become complicated to the <unk>
The <unk> are the time to put them over their body and their options.
When we think about the development of the child, we all know that the first five years are crucial to language and attachment to the brain.
It's a moment in which your day-to-day and common life has an impact on the person who <unk>
But what we don't hear is that there's something called adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in the adult development.
But this is not what the <unk> are listening.
The newspapers talk about changes in the timeline.
The researchers call them an extended adolescence for <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> names of <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we have considered a <unk> which is actually the decade that defines the <unk>
Leonard <unk> said that to make big things, you need a plan and not enough time.
Isn't it true?
What do you think happens when you give a <unk> on your head and say, you have another 10 years to start your <unk>
There's nothing.
They stole that person the sense of urgency and his ambition and it doesn't.
And then every day, the <unk> intelligent, interesting thing like you or your children and daughters come to my office and say something like this: "I know that my boyfriend is not good for me, but this relationship is not to notice.
Or they say, "Everybody says that while I start a career before 30, everything will be right."
But then it starts to sound like this: "My <unk> are for <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
I had a better copy day that I graduated from <unk>
And then it starts to sound like this: "My quotes during the <unk> were like the game of chairs.
They were all running, and they were <unk> but then at some point about 30, he turned out the music and they all began to sit down.
I didn't want to be the only one who would be standing, so I sometimes think I married my husband because he was the nearest chair when he had <unk>
Where are the mountain here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds a little bit extreme, but you don't get <unk> the risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for the <unk> there's a huge pressure to 30 and so many of them start a career, pick a city, pick a partner, and have two or three children in a long period of time.
So many of these things are not <unk> and there is research that you start to show you, which is much more difficult and stressful do everything from the <unk>
The middle of the middle-aged crisis is not about buying red sporting cars.
It's about realizing you can't have the career you want now.
Realizing you can't have the son you want to now, or you can't give a brother to your son.
A lot of <unk> and <unk> look at themselves, and me, sitting in the room, and they talk about their <unk> "What was he thinking?"
I want to change what the <unk> are doing and thinking.
Here's a story about how it might be.
It's a story about a woman named <unk>
By 25, Emma came to my office because he was, in his own words, having an identity.
He said I'd like to work in art or entertainment, but you still couldn't decide, so I spent the last few years working as a <unk>
As it was cheaper, I lived with a boyfriend who showed more <unk> than ambition.
And despite living a few very difficult <unk> his previous life had been even more difficult.
<unk> often in our <unk> but then he would raise herself to say, "You don't pick his family, but you can choose their friends."
Well, one day Emma came up his head on his legs and she cried for almost the whole hour.
I had just bought a new book <unk> and I had spent the whole morning with its many relationships, but then he sat seeing the empty space that follows after the words <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
He was about the <unk> when he looked at me, and he said, "Who is going to be for me if I have an accident.
Who is going to take care of if I give me <unk>
At that time, it took a lot of work to resist and say, <unk>
What Emma needed was not a <unk> that really was <unk>
Emma needed a better life, and I knew this was his opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex as to sit as to sit as a decade and <unk> from Emma passed on.
So for the next few weeks and months, I told Emma three things that every man or a woman, deserves to know.
First of all, I told Emma who was getting away from that crisis of identity and <unk> identity.
For identity, I mean making something add value to your person.
Doing something that is an investment in what you want to be next.
I didn't know the future of <unk> and no one knows the future of work, but I know this: that identity capital generates capital of identity.
So now it's time for that work on the other side of the country, from that company that you want to try to try.
I'm not <unk> the exploration exploration of the exploration that we shouldn't count, that by the way, it's not exploration, which is by the way.
It's <unk>
I told Emma who would explore jobs and make them tell.
Second, I told Emma urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are great to take you to the airport, but the <unk> who come together with friends with similar minds just as well as who you know how to think about, how do they speak, and where they work.
That new piece of capital, that new person who will come out almost always comes from their nearest circle nearby.
The new things come from what they're called weak ties friends from friends from their friends.
Yes, half of the <unk> have a bad job or don't have a job.
But the other half won't, and the weak links are the way we belong to this group.
Half the jobs created is never <unk> so knowing the boss of your neighbor is a way to get a job not published.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how the information happens.
For last but not least, Emma believed that you don't choose your family, but I know their friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but as a <unk> Emma would soon come back to his family, when she has a partner and form his own family.
I told Emma that the time to choose his family had come.
Maybe you think that 30 is better to sit down that 20 or even 25 or even 25 and I agree with you.
But if you choose the person that you live right now, or you're going to tell you now when everyone on Facebook is starting to walk towards <unk> it's not progress.
The best time to work in your marriage is before you have, and that involves being so intentional in love as you're at work.
<unk> your family must be a conscious choice of who and what they want instead of just doing it will work or kill the whoever is you going to do to you.
So what happened to <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she found the roommate <unk> who was working on a art museum in another state.
This weak link helped get a job there.
That work supply gave him a reason to leave the boyfriend to live.
Now, five years later, it's <unk> special of events in museums.
This married man who chose <unk>
I love his new career, they love his new family, and I send me a letter to me that said, "Now the field of emergency contacts are not enough.
The story of Emma may sound easy, but that's what I love to work with <unk>
It's very easy to help.
The <unk> are as planes coming out of the airport from Los Angeles, who go somewhere in the West.
Just before the <unk> a light fit in your trajectory makes the difference between landing in Alaska or <unk>
In the same way, at 21 or 25 and even the <unk> a good conversation, a good break, a good TED Talk can have huge effects in the years or even in the next generation.
Here's my idea that is worth spreading to all the <unk> that know.
It's as simple as what I learned to say to <unk>
This is what I now have the privilege of telling <unk> like Emma every day: <unk> are not the new <unk> <unk> his <unk> get an identity capital -- using their weak <unk> pick your family.
Don't you know what they didn't know or what they didn't know.
They're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very tough job for a job that was even more <unk> the <unk>
I went to teach them mathematics to graduate students in public schools in New York City.
And like any teacher, I applied tests and tests.
I'm going to do assignments.
When the work went back, I would have grades.
What struck me the attention was that <unk> was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of those who had better performance had no credit scores of <unk>
Some of my smartest kids were not going so well.
And that got me thinking.
The kind of thing that you need to learn in mathematics, in seventh grade, sure, are <unk> <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these are not impossible and I was very convinced that each of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and over time enough.
After several years of <unk> I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a <unk> perspective, from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure their best way better.
It's the <unk> but what if you're successful in school and in life depends on much more than the ability to learn <unk> and easy?
So I left the classroom and I went to college to become <unk>
I started studying children and adults in all sorts of <unk> and every study my question was, who has success here and why?
My research team and I went to the <unk> West <unk>
And we're trying to predict what <unk> <unk> in military training.
We went to the National <unk> and we tried to predict what kids were going to be able to do as far as possible in competition.
We studied professors -- working in very difficult neighborhoods -- what teachers are still teaching for the end of the school and <unk> who will be the most effective person in improving the outcomes of their <unk>
We teamed up with private enterprises, what about these marketers are going to keep their job <unk>
And who is going to make more money?
In all these very different contexts, one feature as an important <unk> of success.
And it wasn't social intelligence.
It wasn't good look, physical health, and it wasn't <unk>
It was <unk>
<unk> is passion and resilience to achieve very long-term goals.
<unk> is to have a resistance.
<unk> is embracing your future, day after day, not only for week, not only for years, but for years, and working really hard to make that future a reality.
<unk> is to live life as if it was a <unk> not a bad career.
A few years ago, I started studying the determination of Chicago.
I asked thousands of high school students to do my determination of determination and then waited for about a year to see who was <unk>
It turns out that the more determination of the more determination they had significantly more likely to get more likely to have, even when the <unk> in each of that I could measure, things like the family income, the results of the evidence -- including the security that they felt when they were in school.
So it's not just in West Point or in the National National <unk> where it matters <unk> it's also in school, especially for children at risk of <unk>
For me, the most shocking thing about determination is how little we know, how little science knows about development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How do we make the resolve of the <unk>
What do I have to do to teach kids a work of work?
How do I keep them motivated for the long <unk>
The most honest answer is, I don't know.  What I know is that talent doesn't give them <unk>
Our data shows very clearly that there are many talented individuals that simply don't go ahead with their <unk>
In fact, in our data, it's commonly <unk> it's not related or is even related to today's measures.
So far, the best idea I've heard about developing the determination of children is something called <unk> <unk>
This is an idea that was developed at Stanford University by Carol <unk> and it is the belief that the ability to learn is not the evidence that it can change the effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how they changes and grow in response to the challenge, they are much more likely to get to the challenge, when you die, because they don't think that is a permanent condition.
So the mentality of growth is a great idea to develop <unk>
But we need more.
And that's where I finished my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have to do.
We need to take our best ideas, our stronger intuitions and we need to <unk>
We need to measure if they've been successful and we need to be willing to fail, to start to fail, to start all over again with the <unk>
In other words, we need to be certain about making our kids more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan as a daughter of a <unk> one of my most <unk> memories is my mother <unk> the beauty, the shape and the Chinese character.
Since that time, I was inspired by this incredible language.
But for a overseas, it seems to be as <unk> as the Great Wall of China.
In the last few years, I've been wondering if I can break down this <unk> so that I want to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language can do it.
I started thinking about how a new and quick method of learning Chinese might be useful.
Since I was five years old, I started to learn how to draw each of the strokes in every character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Because we only have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a faster and easy way.
A Chinese academic <unk> 20 thousand characters.
You just need a thousand to understand basic literacy people.
The first 200 will allow us to understand 40 percent of the basic literature, enough enough to read traffic signals, to understand the basic idea of online <unk> or newspapers.
Today I will start with eight to show you how the method works.
Are you ready?
You open your mouth as much as you can even be <unk>
You get a mouth.
This is a person who is going to take a walk.
<unk>
If the form of fire is a person with arms in both sides, like if I were shouting <unk> <unk> -- I'm <unk> This symbol is actually <unk> in the form of <unk> but I like to believe it is the other way.
This is a tree.
tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The symbol of the door looks like a couple of <unk> <unk> in the old West.
I call <unk> to these eight characters.
They are building blocks to create many more characters.
One person.
If someone walks back, that's <unk>
As old said, two are company, three are a <unk>
If a person stretch your arms, this person is saying <unk> that big.
The person inside the mouth is <unk>
It's a politician as <unk> inside the whale.
A tree is a tree. Two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
Put a table under the tree, we have the foundations of ground.
Put a mouth over the tree, that's a <unk>  <unk> of remember, because a single tree is quite an idiot.
Remember fire?
Two tricks together, it's very hot.
Three tricks together, that's a lot of fire.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two <unk> together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Put the sun and the moon together, that's the <unk>
It also means tomorrow, after one day and a night.
The sun comes out of the horizon.
One door, put a chart inside the door, it's the <unk> of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, asking questions.
<unk> played someone at home?
This person is coming out of a door, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, they're <unk>
Three women together, <unk> are <unk>
So we've already gone for almost 30 characters.
By using this method, the first eight radical eight will allow you to build 32.
The next group of eight characters will build other 32.
So with every small effort, you will be able to learn a couple hundred hundred characters, which is the same as you learn a Chinese eight years.
So after knowing the characters, we started creating sentences.
For example, mountain and fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know that Japan is the Earth's sun.
This is a sun resting with the beginning, because Japan is in this China.
So one sun next to the start, we created Japan.
One person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left are two stacked mountains, one over the other.
In the ancient China, that meant in <unk> because the Chinese <unk> will <unk> their political enemies beyond the mountains.
Today, the diaspora has become a date.
A mouth that tells you where to go out is an exit.
This is a slide to remind me that I must stop talking and go on the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be Dad is the movies that I get to see.
I love to share my favorite films with my <unk> when my daughter was four, we saw the magician of Oz together.
The film took his imagination for months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave him a good excuse to use a brilliant dress and lead a magic wand and he took a magic bullet.
But when you see that movie so many times, you get to understand that it's remarkable.
We now live and we raised our children in a kind of industrial complex <unk>
However, the magician of Oz was an event itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend actually took rise later 40 years later with, interestingly, another film whose <unk> a little bit of metal and a guy named <unk> <unk> a girl dresses like guard from the enemy.
Do you know what I'm talking about?  Yes.
There's a big difference between these two films, there's a couple of big differences between the magician of Oz and all the movies that we see today.
One is that there's very little violence in the magician of <unk>
The monkeys are pretty aggressive, like <unk>
But I believe that if the magician magician gets done today, the magician would say, <unk> you are the salvation of Oz like the prophecy.
<unk> magical shoes to defeat the <unk> computer <unk>
But that's not what happens.
Another unique thing about the magician of Oz is that the most <unk> characters and even <unk> are women.
I started to notice this when I was watching "Star <unk> to my daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that time, I also had a child.
three years old.
It wasn't invited to the projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the level of surveillance had <unk>  And so she was so slid in the room and I was struck as a mother leg with her <unk> behind, and I don't think he understood what was happening, but <unk> <unk> everything.
I wonder what <unk>
They would be <unk> resilience and <unk>
I should be the feeling that Luke is one military to remove the government?
I got this with the magician of Oz <unk>
How do I win Dorothy his movie?
We do good <unk> with everybody and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world that I want my kids to grow up, right? And not a world of men who <unk> which is where we are.
Why are there so much as much as so much as extreme capital -- force in the movies for our children, and so little on the road of <unk>
There's a lot of literature about the impact of male violence in the girls, and they should be <unk> It's really good.
I haven't read so much about how kids react to this encouragement.
I know from experience that Princess <unk> doesn't give you the right framework that I would have served to navigate the world of adults who is <unk>  I think at the time of the first kiss.  I think at the time of the first kiss.
My search is done, I have <unk>
Why are they still there?
I don't know what I should do.
The movies are focused on defeat the <unk> and get their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like being a child, you have to be a stupid animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a <unk>
There are many exceptions, to defend <unk> from Disney to any of you.
But they send a message to children, even though they, the guys, are not really their goal.
They do a fantastic work by teaching girls how to defend themselves against <unk> but they don't necessarily show kids how to defend the <unk>
There's no model for them.
We also have some great women who write new stories for our children, so real and lovely as <unk> and <unk> but they don't stop being movies of war.
Of course, the most successful issue of all of the time continues to appear in classic early after classic -- each of them about the adventures of a child or a man or two men who are friends, or a man and your son, or two men who are wearing a child.
Until many of you are thinking, this year, he finally came out of it.
I recommend all of you. It's already available in shops.
Do you remember what criticism said when he went <unk>
I can't believe that Pixar has made a movie of a <unk>
It's very good. Don't let that be <unk>
Well, almost none of these films happens the test test.
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It still hasn't taken root and already <unk> but maybe we're going to start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a comic book comics, and in the <unk> '80s, I recorded a conversation that had been with a friend of the movies that you saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions that have to be <unk> In the movie, there is more of a female character that has <unk>
So you have to fulfill the <unk>
These women talk to each other.
Their conversations are more than the guy that we like it.  Okay? Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.
Two women who exist and they talk about things each other.
<unk> I've seen, and yet very rarely I see it in the movie that we know and love.
In fact, this week, I went to see a very good quality, <unk>
Right? <unk> <unk> success -- an idea of consensus what is a Hollywood movie Hollywood film.
<unk> don't happen to <unk>
And I don't think it <unk> because a lot of the movie, I don't know if you've seen it, a lot of the film happens in a embassy where men and women are hidden during the crisis of <unk>
We have a lot of scenes of men who have profound conversations and painful conversations in this <unk> and it's the great time for one of the actors to take a look at the door and say, <unk> bed, <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So let's put it in the numbers.
In 2011, of the most popular films, how many of them believe that they have actors <unk>
<unk> It's not bad.
It's not the same percentage that the number of women we've chosen recently for Congress, then it's okay.
But there's a larger number that this is going to do is this room.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
This is what he said, <unk>
In the United States, one in five women said he's been sexually sexually sexually in their life.
I don't think it's the guilt of mass entertainment.
I don't think movies for kids to have something to do with that.
I don't think the music videos or pornography are tightly <unk> but something is wrong, and when I hear that statistics, one of the things I think is there is a lot of sex <unk>
Who are those <unk> What are those <unk>
What can't they get <unk>
They're <unk> the story that says that the role of a male hero, is to beat the <unk> with violence and then charge the reward, which is a woman who has no friends and not <unk>
We are <unk> that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same thing, we find this world and this very disturbing statistic and we want to get it together.
We have tools to our disposal like <unk> <unk> and we hope that <unk> but I have to ask, <unk> <unk> is going to <unk> if, at the same time, active or <unk> we are educating our children to keep their own <unk>
I mean, I think the Netflix list is a way to do something really important, and here I mean most of the parents.
I think we have to show our kids male -- a new definition of <unk>
The definition of <unk> is radically changing.
You will have read about how the new economy is changing the role that they care about home and <unk>
It's all changing.
When I asked my daughter, what was his favorite of his favorite Star Wars <unk> Do you know what he <unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What do these two?
Maybe it's not just the brilliant dress at all.
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those films that know more than anyone, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to try to reach their potential.
They're leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want less stories in which I'm telling my <unk> <unk> and fight only and more stories where he looked at work is to join a team -- maybe a team led by women, helping other people to improve and be better people, like the magician <unk>
Thank you.
As a child, I was living in Maine and one of the things that I liked was looking for the sea <unk> on the shores of Maine -- because my parents told me that I would give me lucky.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They're covered in sand and it's hard to see them.
And yet, over time, I went to <unk>
I started to see shapes and patterns that helped me <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, in a love for the past and the archeology.
And finally when I started studying <unk> I realized that I saw my own eyes wasn't enough.
Because, suddenly, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine had grown up to about 3,000 miles of length along with the <unk>
And my sea cookies had grown up to the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite images.
To try to make a map of the past, I knew I had to see it differently.
I want to show you an example of how different we see by using the infrared
This is a place located in the eastern Delta of Egypt called <unk>
And the place, in plain seems to be brown, but when we use infrared and we process it using fake color -- suddenly the place looks like pink <unk>
What you're seeing is the real chemical changes of the landscape caused by the building materials and the ancient Egyptian.
I want to share with you how we used satellite data to find an old city, old called <unk> lost for thousands of years.
<unk> was the capital of the ancient Egypt for over 400 years in a period of time called the Middle Empire about 4,000 years ago.
The place lies in the <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Middle Empire, there was this great renaissance of ancient art, architecture and religion.
The <unk> have always known that <unk> was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings than <unk> <unk> within the red circles here, but somewhere inside this huge <unk> <unk>
This area is massive, it's about <unk> by <unk> miles.
Before, the Nile <unk> right next to <unk> and as it changed over time, moved this and covered the whole city.
So how do you find a city <unk> in a <unk>
And I'm trying to try to find it the equivalent of looking for a needle in a <unk> with the eyes <unk> and using baseball <unk>
So we use NASA <unk> data to make a map of place, with very subtle changes.
So we were able to see where it was <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this very high area that you see inside the circle here, which we think could be the location of <unk>
So we collaborated with scientists who are working on <unk> jobs you can see here.
When I say <unk> it's like the shots of this show on ice, but instead of layers of climate change, we look for layers of human occupation looking at layers of human <unk>
Five feet down, below a thick layer of mud, and we found a dense layer of <unk> objects.
This means that in this possible location of <unk> five feet down, we have a layer of occupation of several hundred years that date out of the Roman Empire exactly the same period that we think is <unk>
We also found <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> what shows that there was a workshop of <unk>
This might seem that it's not a lot, but when we think of the most common stones used in the jewelry of the Ottoman Empire, these are the stones that are <unk>
So we have a dense layer of occupation that goes from the Middle Empire in this place.
We also have evidence of a elite jewelry, which proves that what has been there, was a very important city.
We don't yet find <unk> here, but we would go to the place in a near future for <unk>
And even more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so that they can also make great discoveries.
I want to finish with my favorite quote from the Roman Empire, probably written in <unk> 4,000 years ago.
To share knowledge is the biggest of all the <unk>
There's nothing like that.
So according to TED I was not founded in 1984 <unk> C.
Do you feel that the ideas actually started in 1984 B.C. in a lost city not for a long time and found from the high.
It certainly puts the <unk> search for <unk>
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing outside, in front of the door of <unk> home.
I want you to pay attention to the color of the door, the material that is made.
Now let's give a group of obese <unk> a <unk>
They're competing in a <unk> career and go back to their front door.
I need you to see this <unk>
They're <unk> <unk> they're <unk> they're <unk>
And they collide against the door of your house.
There are bicycles flying around, wheels that go on to their side, rays from the wheels that end up in places that end up in <unk> places, the threshold of the door, <unk>
And the <unk> in the hall, or what there is on the next side of the door, and look at the quality of light. The light is shining on the <unk> of <unk>
It's waving with the hand.
From his chair, on a brown horse.
It's a horse that is talking about.
You can feel your blue <unk> you can tickle your nose.
You can smell the <unk> <unk> and you can be able to get into the mouth.
They went on one side and enter your living room.
In the room, and making it much of his imagination, imagine Britney <unk>
It's with little clothes, dancing on his center center, singing <unk> singing <unk> One more <unk>
Now let's go to the kitchen.
The ground has been coated with a yellow brick path and from the oven come to you <unk> Man of <unk> the <unk> and the Len of "The Wizard of <unk> <unk> of hands, jumping up to you.
Okay. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a particular competition that takes every spring in New York City.
It's called the <unk> of the United States."
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a <unk> journalist, I guess, that this was like the end of a <unk> <unk>
There were several men and a few different ages and different habits of sanitation.
They were <unk> hundreds of numbers <unk> them just once.
It took the names of tens and tens of strangers.
<unk> poems full of just minutes.
<unk> to see who was able to memorize the order of a deck of <unk>
And I was like, "This is <unk>
These people must be made of nature.
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This one, this is a man named Ed Cook, who had come from England and has one of the better memories.
I asked her, <unk> when you realized you were a <unk>
Ed replied, "I'm not a wise.
Actually, I have a average memory.
Everybody involved in this competition say they have normal memory.
"We have been trained to do these miraculous acts of memory using some old old techniques invented 2,500 years ago in Greece, the same techniques that I used <unk> to memorize their speakers, and that the <unk> academics used to memorize books.
And my reaction was: <unk> How did I have not heard of this <unk>
We were standing out of the hall of competition, and <unk> who is a wonderful and brilliant English -- although a little bit <unk> he said, <unk> you are an American journalist.
You know Britney <unk>
And I said, "What? No, why?
Because I'd like to teach Britney <unk> how to memorize the order in a deck of cards live on national TV.
That will prove to the world that anybody can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me to me.
I mean, you have to start by something right?"
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me.
It ended up most of the next year, not just training my memory, but also <unk> trying to understand how it works, why sometimes it doesn't work and what your potential can be.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man named <unk>
He is <unk> very likely with the worst memory in the world.
Their memory was so bad that I didn't even remember that I had a problem of <unk> it's amazing.
Somebody was incredibly tragic, but it was a window that allows you to see the point of our memory that we are.
On the other end of the spectrum, I met this man.
This is Kim <unk> He was based on <unk> paper <unk> in the movie <unk> <unk>
We spent a afternoon in the public library of Salt Lake City <unk> <unk> <unk> was <unk>
And in return, I read a number of treaties on memory that was written over 2,000 years ago in Latin, in <unk> and then in the Dark Ages.
And I learned so many really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time that this idea of having a disciplined and disciplined memory was not such a rare thing as it might look like today.
A long time ago, people invest in their memory, to provide their minds.
These techniques have made our modern world, but they've also changed.
They have changed the culturally, and I would say that they have changed a lot of cognitive beings.
We have no need to remember, sometimes we have forgotten how we have forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where people are still very passionate about this idea of a disciplined and disciplined memory -- is this very singular competition of memory.
It's actually not so <unk> there are <unk> like this all over the world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a group of University University University London invited a group of memory champions to the lab.
They wanted to know, whether it has brains in some sense, structural or <unk> different from the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
Are you more intelligent than <unk>
They gave them a cognitive <unk> and the answer was actually not.
There was yet a really interesting and significant difference between the brains of the memory champions and the subjects of control with the <unk>
When they put them in a MRI machine -- it <unk> their brains as they <unk> numbers, faces and forms of snow.
They actually <unk> or looked at a part of the brain that involves spatial and navigation.
Why? There's something we can learn from this?
The tournament of <unk> <unk> is driven as an armed career, where each year, someone has a new way of remembering more things, more quickly, and then the rest of the competitors must get a day.
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times of memory.
On his desk in front of him, there is 36 <unk> <unk> <unk> that he's about to try to memorize an hour, using a technique that he invented and he just <unk>
He used a similar technique to memorize the very precise order of <unk> digits <unk>
<unk> Yes.
And as there is a great amount of ways of remembering things in these competence, absolutely all the techniques used at the end of the end is just reduced to one concept that psychologists call <unk>
It illustrates with an paradox known as the <unk> <unk> <unk> says this: I say to two people who remember the same word. I say to you, <unk> that there's a man called <unk>
That's his <unk>
And then I ask you, <unk> that there's a <unk> <unk>
And when I go back later, and I ask them to tell them that word I told you a <unk>
So what do you do?"
The person who was told that his name is Baker is unlikely to remember the same word that the person who was told that his job is <unk>
The same word, different <unk> capacity. That's weird.
What about here?
Well, the name Baker, actually doesn't mean anything for you. It's no relationship to you.
With all the other memories you dance for their head.
But the word <unk> We know <unk>
They use <unk> white <unk>
They have <unk>
<unk> when they come home to work.
Probably some <unk>
And when you look at that word for the first time, we started putting <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> at some time back.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this dates back two years ago in the <unk>
It's known as the <unk> of <unk>
The story says this: There was a poet called <unk> which I attended a <unk>
They had hired it like entertainment, because before, if I wanted to give a very good party, you didn't put a <unk> to a <unk>
He stood up, <unk> his memory poem, and he was <unk> and so soon it was, the <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> everybody.
But not only did I kill everybody, but it shattered the bodies of <unk>
Nobody could say who was there, no one could remember where they were sitting there.
So they wouldn't be able to make them <unk>
A tragedy behind the other.
<unk> stopped outside, just survivor, in the middle of the rubble, closed eyes and realized that with his eyes of his mind, I could see where it had been sitting around each other.
I took the family of his hand <unk> where they were their loved ones between rubble.
So what we <unk> volunteers at that moment is something that we all know more or less <unk> and is that no matter whether we're not good at remembering names or phone numbers or instructions for word <unk> we have a word of our colleagues, we have an amazing space and remarkable spatial memory.
If you let me tell you, the first 10 words of the story I just told you about <unk> is very likely that they are very difficult to do it.
But I would bet that if you asked them to say who was sitting on the horse speaker, brown in his lobby, would be capable of <unk>
The idea of the memory palace is to create this building with the eyes of his mind and images of images with the things that you want to remember.
This is a advice that comes from over 2,000 years ago to the first <unk> of memory <unk>
And how does it work?
Let's say that you have been invited to the TED stage to give a talk and you want to make it from memory, in the same way that I would have done it <unk> if you had invited it to <unk> 2,000 years ago.
What you might do is imagine that they're at the door of your house.
And to come up with some kind of <unk> image -- crazy and <unk> to help them remember that the first thing you want to mention is that competition completely <unk>
And then you can imagine coming into your house, and see the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I'll remember that you want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then you would see Britney <unk> to remind you that funny anecdote that you want to tell.
And then they come in the kitchen, and the fourth issue that they would talk would be that strange journey that they made for one year, and they have some friends to help them remember it.
This is how the speakers <unk> <unk> the <unk> -- not word for word, which will be confused but typical for typical.
In fact the term <unk> comes from the Greek <unk> which means <unk>
It's a <unk> of when people thought about <unk> and the rhetoric with this kind of kind of spatial terms.
The phrase <unk> first <unk> would be like the first place in his palace of memory.
I saw that this was just fascinating, and I got involved in that.
I went to some of these memory skills, and I had the idea of writing something a big thing about this <unk> of <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is a boring <unk> event.
Seriously, is how to see a lot of people sitting on <unk> I mean, the most exciting thing that happens is when someone got off the front.
I'm a journalist, and I need to be able to write about something.
I know there are amazing things going on in the minds of these people, but I have no access.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try and put it into it.
So I started spending 15 or 20 minutes every morning, before I sit to see the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an old school <unk> bought in a marketplace of <unk>
And I discovered that this was <unk>
I would have never expected that I was doing it.
It was fun, because it wasn't just training the memory.
What it is really about doing is to get better and more the ability to create and imagine these images that are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of the mind.
I was really hooked up with this.
This is me, using my standard training team for the competition of memory.
It's a couple of <unk> and some security glasses covered with tape leaving only two <unk> because the distraction is the worst enemy of a <unk> of memory.
And I ended up coming back to the same competition that I had covered a year before. I had the idea that I could actually put it into a kind of <unk> <unk> experiment.
I thought this might be good <unk> for all my research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won the <unk> something I didn't have to happen.
Of course, it's nice to be able to memorize narratives and phone numbers and shopping ready, but actually this is not the point.
These are just so only <unk> <unk> that work.
Because they are based on very basic principles about how the brain works.
And you don't need to be able to build <unk> of memory or memorize <unk> <unk> to benefit from a little bit of insights about how your mind.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it was a gift of <unk> but it's not the case.
The big memories are <unk>
At the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
<unk> when we focus deeply.
The palace of <unk> These memory techniques are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even <unk> really.
They work because they make us <unk>
<unk> a kind of deep processing, a kind of attention that most of us are not <unk> around.
But the reality is that there's no shortcuts.
This is how things do <unk>
And if there is something I want to leave you with today, is what I think -- the <unk> I couldn't even remember that I had a memory problem, I left me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose what is already our short <unk> existence in the <unk> or <unk> not paying attention to the human being in front of us, who walks to our side.
I learned from first hand that there are incredible memory capacities for all of us.
But if you want to live a living, you must be the kind of person that remember remember.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you about the last 30 years of architecture history.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It's a complex subject, and so let's just take a place -- New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I was about <unk> boat, I was six years ago, and I lived there in my parents' house, in a village called <unk> and this was my child's bedroom.
In the corner, from my bedroom, I was the bathroom that I shared with my sister.
And in my bedroom and the bathroom, there was a balcony that gave the living room.
And there they were all over the time watching television -- so every time I went from my room to the bathroom, I all looked at me, and every time I went back, and I would come back on a towel that I saw me.
And I was like this.
It was <unk> not <unk>
<unk> that tour, I hated that <unk> hated that room and that house.
That's the architecture.
That's right.
Those feelings, those emotions that I felt, is the power of architecture, because architecture is not all about math, and of that of the area, but of those connections, emotional connections that we feel in the places that <unk>
And it's not surprising that we feel that way, because according to Environmental Protection Agency -- the Americans spend 90 percent of their time under roof.
I mean, 90 percent of the time are surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
architecture determines in ways we don't even notice.
That makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
That means that when I show you a building like this, I know what you would think about you think about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know that they think about it by based on a building building two thousand years ago.
This is a trick.
It's a <unk> that use architects to create an emotional connection with the ways we build our buildings.
It's an emotional connection -- we've used this trick for a long, long time.
We use it 200 years ago to build banks.
We used it in the 19th century to build art museums.
And in the 20th century, we use it to build houses.
Look, these <unk> stable, <unk> in front of the sea, away from the elements.
This is very, very useful, because building things is terrifying.
It's expensive, it's expensive, and it's very complicated.
The people who are <unk> and governments, are always afraid to innovation, and they prefer to use ways that they know they're going to work.
So we met buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
This is the Public Library of <unk> which was finished in 2004, in my hometown, and, you know, it has a <unk> it has this round thing, columns red, the red brick -- and they leave <unk> what <unk> is trying to communicate with this <unk> the kids, the <unk>
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year, in 2004, the other side of the country, was finished another library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use media in the digital era.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to come together, read and share.
So how is it possible that in the same year, in the same country, two buildings, both so-called libraries, are so completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works on the beginning of the <unk>
On one side there is the <unk> the architects that constantly drive new technologies, new <unk> new solutions for today's forms for life.
We were going to push us and we gave them so much, that we get away from the people.
All of the black, this is <unk> you think we feel very good, but we're dead because we don't have another option.
We need to go to the other side and go back to connect with those symbols in it.
So we do that, and we are all happy, but we feel like <unk> So we started to experience <unk> we are doing the present back to go ahead and over and over again, so we've done it in the last 300 years, and of course it is in the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago that the '70s.
The architects were busy experimenting with the so-called <unk>
It has to do with the concrete.
You can guess.
<unk> small <unk>
Something really hard.
So we get to the '80s, and we started adopting those symbols.
It was going to be the same in the other direction.
We take those shapes that we know and <unk>
<unk> <unk> and we add cake. and we use new materials.
They love it.
We don't give them <unk>
We took <unk> <unk> and we turned them into manufacturing that can be <unk> medieval <unk>
The shapes <unk> they won in audacity and <unk>
The <unk> became columns.
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
insane.
But it was the 1980s, that was great.
We all spent the time in commercial centers, and we moved to the neighborhoods, and there, in the suburbs, we can create our own erotic <unk>
Those erotic fantasies could be <unk> or <unk>
Maybe with a <unk> of bread.
This is what happens with the <unk>
This is what happens to the symbols.
They're easy, it's cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, we attach memories of other places.
I know very well, and you all know, this is not the <unk>
This is <unk>
Architects feel frustrated and we started making the pendulum going to the other direction.
In the 1980s and in the early '90s, we started experimenting with the so-called <unk>
<unk> the <unk> symbols now tell us with new design techniques, and we found ourselves with new <unk> a few shapes that are being stored against other forms.
This is academic and <unk> and it's <unk> -- you have totally <unk>
Normally, the pendulum <unk> again in the opposite direction.
But then something happened.
In 1997, it opened this building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building fundamentally changed the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said that Bilbao was one of these rare moments when critical academic and audience in general, were completely agree on a building.
The New York Times <unk> this construction of <unk>
<unk> in Bilbao increased in two and a half percent when they finished the building.
So, all of a sudden, everybody wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, Seattle, New York, Cleveland, <unk>
The whole world wanted one, and he Gehry was everywhere.
He was our first star.
But how is it possible that these forms of wild and <unk> how is it possible to become ubiquitous around the world?
And it happened, because the media was around them, and we quickly learned that those shapes as culture and tourism.
We created an emotional reaction with these forms.
The same thing did the top mayors in the world.
So everybody believed that if they had these forms, they had culture and tourism.
This phenomenon in the beginning of the new millennials happened with another star.
It happened to <unk> and <unk> and what happened with these few elite architects on the threshold of the new millennium, actually started going with all the architecture, the digital media began to increase the speed of the information consumption.
Think of it, for example, how we consume architecture.
A thousand years ago, you would have to have walked up to the next town to see a building.
And shipping is <unk> you can take a boat, a plane, you can be <unk>
<unk> technology, you can see in the newspapers, on TV, and in the end, we are all photographers in architecture, and the building is transported beyond its physical location.
The architecture is all over right now; that means that the speed of communications has finally reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture is moving so fast.
It doesn't take a lot of time to think about a building.
You need a lot of time to build a building, three or four years, and in that time, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 buildings, before we knew that I designed four years ago was a success or not.
Because there's never been good feedback on architecture.
That's how we find buildings like this.
The <unk> was not a two-year-old movement, but 20 years.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this, because we had no idea how much the <unk>
That's never going to happen, because we're at the threshold of the biggest revolution in architecture since the invention of the <unk> of steel or <unk> and is the media revolution.
My theory is that when the pendulum applied to media is starting to swing faster and faster, to get in both extremes almost in <unk> and it was effectively the difference between innovation and symbol, between us, the architects, and you, the public.
Now we can make symbols almost <unk> with an emotional load of something completely new.
I'll show you how the system works in a project that my company ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building that <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> in <unk> Island, in New York City.
It's a vacation.
But that meant that two years before the building was over, it was already part of the community, and as the drawings looked like exactly the product finished, no surprises.
The building came to be part of the community, that first summer, when people started to get and share it in social media, the building stopped being just a building, it became a media medium, because these are not just images of a building, they're the images that you made of the building.
And as you use it to tell your story, they become part of the personal narrative, and that makes it <unk> with collective memory, and by carrying these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks to tell us how to think of architecture.
We can tell each other what we think of architecture, because digital media not only changed the relationship between us, but that have changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think about a second in those librarians of <unk>
If that building was built today, first of the Internet to look for <unk> <unk>
<unk> bombarded with examples of <unk> innovation, about what a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> that you can lead to the mayor of <unk> to people of <unk> and tell them that there is no unique response to what you can be a library today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions is the freedom to experience.
Everything is different now.
Architects are no longer those mysterious creatures that use words <unk> and complicated, and one is no longer a <unk> audience that doesn't accept something that you haven't seen before.
The architects can listen, and you don't stop <unk> by architecture.
That means that the pendulum <unk> of a style to another, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find solutions right to problems facing society.
This is the end of the history of architecture, and it means that the buildings in the morning will be very different to the buildings today.
This means that an public space in the ancient city of <unk> can be unique and adapted to the extent of a modern city.
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad imitation of red brick on ideas of what it should be a stadium.
That means that some robots will be able to build our buildings, because we will finally be ready for the shapes that are going to make.
That means that the buildings will become the whims of nature and not the opposite.
This means that a parking garage garage in Miami Beach, Florida, it can also serve to make sport or to <unk> or even you can get married there at night.
This means that three architects can dream swimming on the East New York City <unk> and raising half a million dollars of the surrounding community around that cause, it's no longer a customer alone.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this little <unk> pavilion, so <unk> and <unk> like the animals that are going to observe.
Because no matter whether it's a cow or a robot that builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we build it, which matters is what we build.
Architects already know how to make buildings more <unk> more intelligent and more kind.
We've been waiting for all of you to want.
Finally, we're not at the opposite direction.
Find an architect, <unk> and <unk> together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot of play.
Buildings not only reflect our society, but they give the more <unk> spaces the local libraries -- households where our children are formed and the step in the bedroom to the bathroom.
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It just turned out a year and already started walking.
And it does it in that great way, a typical of the children of a year, <unk> as if his body was moving too fast for his legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that I like to do is look at the mirror.
She really loves his reflex.
It <unk> and <unk> and it gives itself these big <unk>
It's beautiful.
Apparently, all of his friends do this and my mom tells me that I used to do it, and I thought, When did I stop doing this?
How is it all of a sudden we're not comfortable with our <unk>
Because, apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people are looking for me in Google: "I'm <unk>
This is <unk> it's 13 years old and lives in <unk>
And as any teenager just wants to be loved and fit in.
It's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for next week in school.
It has a little bit of fear, it's a little bit confused because, even though his mom tells him all the time that it's beautiful, every day in school, someone says it is ugly.
Among what his mom tells him and what her friends or colleagues said, <unk> don't know who you believe.
So a video of herself does it on YouTube, he publishes it on YouTube, and he asks others that please leave a <unk> "I'm nice or I'm <unk>
Well, until now, <unk> has gotten over 13,000 comments.
Some of these are so <unk> that it doesn't even deserve to think about them.
We talked about a normal and normal teenager, who receives these answers in one of their most vulnerable life stages of their most vulnerable life stages.
Thousands of people are publishing videos like this, mostly teenage girls trying to communicate this way.
But what is doing this?
Well, the teenagers today almost never are alone.
They're under pressure on online and available all the time, talking, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- this is never over.
We've never been so connected, we have never been so connected, in a continuous way, so young.
As a mother said, "It's like there's a party in your room all the <unk>
There's simply no privacy.
And the social pressures that go from the hand with that are <unk>
This environment, of being connected to being connected is <unk> our children to <unk> based on the number of likes that have and the kinds of comments that they do.
There's no divide between a life online and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what is real or what it isn't.
And also, it's very hard to know the difference between what is authentic and what is paid.
What's the best thing in the life of someone in front of what is normal in a context of every day?
And where are you looking for <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are <unk> from the girls right now.
<unk> <unk> continue to dominate our <unk>
<unk> technique is now routine.
And trends like <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those of you who call it, <unk> means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in popular culture today.
It's not hard to see what young people are.
But the kids are not immune to this.
Like the superheroes of superheroes and the folk singers in <unk>
But what's the problem with all this?
Well, we certainly want our kids to grow healthy and be individuals.
But in a culture that is obsessed with the image, we're teaching our kids to spend more time and effort to look at their appearance, at the price of all other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical capability, their studies and other aspects begin to suffer.
Six in 10 girls prefer not to do something because they think they don't look good enough.
These are not <unk> activities.
They are fundamental activities for their growth as humans and how we taxpayers and the field of labor development.
31 percent, almost one of three teenagers are not interested in arguments in class.  participating in the classroom debates because they don't want to call attention to their physical <unk>
One in five are not attending to classes at all over the days when you don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the season of tests, if you don't think you look good enough, specifically if you don't think you're good enough, you get a lower note to the average of your fellow people who don't care about how it looks.
And this phenomenon has widespread in Finland, United States and China, China.
And it comes regardless of what these young people are.
So to make it clear of course, we are talking about how you see it not about what you're like.
The low self-esteem on his body is <unk> the academic yield.
And it's also <unk> health.
<unk> with little self-esteem do less physical activity, they eat less fruit and vegetables, they participate in more diet not healthy than they can take them into a food disorder that they can bring them to a food disorder that they can bring them to a food disorder.
They have low self-esteem.
They're more easily <unk> by people around and are at greater risk of depression.
And we think that's because of all of this because of what they make more <unk> decisions like alcohol consumption and drug drugs, diet <unk> surgery, psychological surgery, and no protection and harm damage.
The search for the perfect body is pushing health care system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women who think they are overweight again, regardless of whether or don't have higher rates of <unk>
On 17 percent of women don't present to a job interview in a day where they don't feel secure with the way you see.
Think for a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, what would that <unk>
We have this potential for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, speaking, by itself, it doesn't take you very far.
It's not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key points. The first is that we need to instill trust in its own body.
We have to help our teenagers develop strategies to overcome the pressure of perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are a lot of programs available to do it.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
And I was really amazed when I learned that a lot of <unk> programs without realizing it, <unk> the situation.
So we need to make sure that the program that we follow our children will not only have a positive impact, but also a lasting impact.
And research studies show that the best programs focus on six key areas. The first is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
These six aspects of them are kind of crucial to anybody who are willing to provide an education in body self-esteem that works.
A education is fundamental -- but to address this problem requires each of us to take the reins on the world, and let's be a better model for women and girls in our own lives.
So challenging the current status of how women are seen and I mentioned in our circles.
It's not good to count on the input from our politicians in <unk> or the size of their <unk> or <unk> that the determination or success of an Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it's not a great beauty.
We need to begin to judge people by what they are, not as you see them.
We all can start by taking responsibility for the kind of images and the comments that we published in our social networks.
We can engage people based on their effort and their actions and not in their appearance.
And let me ask you, When was the last time you put a <unk>
In short, we have to work together as communities, as governments and companies to change our culture, so that our children will grow to valuing their whole person, valuing the diversity, the <unk>
We have to put people who are actually making the difference in a <unk>
To make a difference in the real world, let's make them be the ones that go on the great screen, because we just create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they think they are never going to be <unk> of being the ones who are, or to reach what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for somebody in their lives.
Who are in mind?
<unk>
<unk>
<unk>
<unk> his <unk>
It could be simply the woman who is on two car seats. What would it mean for her if he was liberated from that voice <unk> in his interior, that he would be <unk> for not having long legs, <unk> <unk> <unk> feet more <unk> feet.
So what would it mean for her if we were doing this, and we would be able to tell their potential that way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with the images are all <unk> all of us.
But let's give our kids the truth.
You know, the way you see you are just a part of your identity, and that the truth is that we love them for those who are and what they do, and because they make us feel.
They went to self-esteem in the <unk> of our schools.
Let's switch every one of us, the way we talk about and we compare to other people.
And they <unk> together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the small <unk> of a year of age today, becoming safe agents of self tomorrow.
Let's do it.
On November November of 1990, a gentleman named <unk> <unk> walked into a hotel in Manhattan and killed the Palestinian rabbi, <unk> the leader of the League of <unk>
At <unk> initially they said, but being a prisoner for other charges -- in others, they started planning attacks about 12 of New York, including <unk> <unk> and the U.N. headquarters and the U.N. headquarters
And luckily, these plans were <unk> by an informant of the FBI.
Sadly, the World Trade bomb in the World Trade Center could not avoid.
Later on, he would be convicted of their participation in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being an engineer with a <unk> an American mother, a high school master's school teacher who was the two they did for me a happy childhood,
Only when I was seven years, our family started to change.
My father taught me a form of Islam, that very few, even most Muslims come to meet.
And I saw that when people take time to interact, it doesn't take much to want to want the same things in life.
However, in all religion, in all of the human group, there is always a small fraction of people who are being used so <unk> to their convictions that think that we have to use all possible media so that everybody lived like them.
A few months before he arrest him, he sat down with me and explained to me that in the last weekends, he and some friends, had been going to train training over Long Island, to practice.
He told me that I would go with him the next day.
We got to the <unk> <unk> which, without knowing our group, was <unk> by the FBI.
When my father touched me my father helped me hold my shoulder on my shoulder and explained to me how to aim for about 30 feet.
That day, with the last bullet that he <unk> gave the little orange light on the target and to surprise all of all, especially me, all the objective broke on fire.
My uncle turned into the other and in Arabic, said <unk> <unk>
As a child, such a child.
All of all, the comment made a lot of laughter. But just a few years later, I understood what they were so funny.
You saw in me, the same level of destruction that my father could <unk>
Those people later would be convicted of putting a stick with 700 kilos of explosives in the underground parking lot of the World Trade Center, causing a explosion that killed six people and hurt the other 1,000.
I admired those men.
He called them <unk> which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I had moved 20 times. That instability during my childhood wasn't allowed to do a lot of <unk>
Every time I started to feel comfortable about somebody who was already a moment of packing and going to another city.
As I was a new face of the class as I was often a <unk>
<unk> secret my identity to avoid being the white -- but it will be the new of the class, quiet and <unk> it was enough <unk>
So most of the time I spent at home reading books, watching television or playing video games.
For these reasons I haven't developed social skills, to say, <unk> -- growing under <unk> I wasn't prepared for the real world.
It strikes me to judge people, based on <unk> indicators as their race or their religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences that I test my thinking was during the 2008 presidential elections.
In a <unk> program where I was involved in the National Convention in Philadelphia.
My group was <unk> at the subject of juvenile violence, like I had been <unk> almost all my life, was something that I felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from different <unk>
One day, at the end of the <unk> I found that one of the kids who we had done friendships, was Jewish was Jewish.
I took a number of days to go to the light this detail and I realized that there was no <unk> among the two.
I had never had a Jewish friend and frankly, I felt very proud to have beat the barrier that my entire life was made me to believe that it was <unk>
Another crucial moment came out when I got a summer job in Bush <unk> a <unk> park.
I found myself with people from all sorts of beliefs and cultures that were fundamental to the development of my character.
The whole life was taught me that the <unk> was a sin and, by extension, all gay were bad <unk>
By the chance, I had the opportunity to work with gay actors there, in a show, and I could see that several of them were the kinder and less critics who had seen in life.
Having been <unk> as a child, I developed a sense of empathy to the suffering of others, but it wasn't easy for me to treat people kind, exactly how I wish being treated.
And so I was able to contrast the stereotypes that I had taught me as a child, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know what that is being <unk> but I know what it is to be <unk> by something beyond my control.
Then came the <unk> <unk>
All night, Jon Stewart was making me <unk> honest about my <unk> and helped me see that race of people, religion or sexual orientation, They have nothing to do with the character.
In many shapes he turned my figure out at a moment where I was desperately <unk>
On occasion, inspiration can come from the unexpected. And that a Jewish comedian would have had a better influence in my life than my own father, <unk> was not in vain.
One day I had a conversation with my mother about how I was changing my thinking, and she told me something that I keep in my heart forever, while he's alive.
She looked at me with her eyes tired of someone who has suffered enough with endless eyes and said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that time, I realized how much negative energy, you need to keep all that hatred inside your inside.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
It changed when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why do I decided to go out and put myself in a possible risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done it because I hope that someone, someday, I am trying to lead to violence, I can hear my story and understand that there is a better way, than even though I would join this violent ideology and <unk> I didn't get to me <unk>
Instead, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and against the prejudice.
I do it by the victims of terrorism and their loved loved ones, for the terrible pain and the losses that terrorism has produced them in their lives.
By the age of terrorism to speak, against those acts of no sense, such as rejection of my father.
With this <unk> I put me here as a proof that violence is not inherent to any religion or race, that kids don't have to follow the paths of their parents.
I'm not my father.
Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Right now, there's a film that was projected in your minds.
It's an amazing movie.
It's 3D and it has <unk> sound that you hear and you see right now. But that's just the beginning.
Your film has color, taste and texture.
It feels your body, your pain, your hearing, your pleasure.
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It has memories, as a time of your childhood that project in front of your eyes.
And it has constantly a selfish voice in your conscious thinking.
The heart of the movie is you who experiences everything directly.
This film is your flow of consciousness, the subject of the experience of mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths of the existence of being human.
Each one of us is conscious.
We all have an inner film, you and you and you.
There's nothing to do it directly.
At least I know that I have a personal awareness.
I don't have any confident that you are conscious.
Consciousness is also the reason for living.
If we weren't aware of anything in our lives it would make sense or value.
But at the same time is the most mysterious phenomenon of the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why do we have these films <unk>
Why aren't we just robots that we have to have to produce outcomes without experiencing the movie <unk>
Right now, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate consciousness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible for consciousness.
The science of science, is objective to objective it.
Consciousness for nature, is <unk>
So there can never be a science of consciousness.
Because for almost all of the 20th century, that vision.
The psychology was studying <unk> behavior, the neuroscience was a <unk> brain, but nobody mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED started, there were very few scientific jobs about consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, everything started to change.
It took Francis Crick and physicists like Roger <unk> they said, <unk> is the time for science to get <unk>
And since then, there was a real bang, an <unk> of the scientific work about consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental limitations to the moment.
The center of the science of consciousness in recent years was search for <unk> correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw some of this guy on the fantastic work I presented Nancy <unk> a few minutes ago.
We now understand much better, for example, the areas of the brain that are related to the conscious experience of seeing faces or feeling pain or feeling happy.
But this is still a science of <unk>
It's not a science of explanations.
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of conscious experience, but we don't know why.
And I'd like to explain that this kind of work of neuroscience responds to some questions that we want to explain consciousness. The questions about what certain areas of the brain is and what they get in.
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
No offense to the <unk>
There's no easy problem with consciousness.
Well not tackles the real mystery of this <unk> Why all the physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why is there an internal film, <unk>
Right now, we cannot understand.
And you can say, let's give it a few years to neuroscience.
It's going to become another emerging phenomenon like <unk> as the <unk> like life, and we're going to find an explanation.
The typical <unk> are all of all cases of emerging behaviors, how do we operate the <unk> how do we work, how do they work and adapt and <unk> the living organisms all are questions about the target work.
That could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and functions of the human brain as a devastating phenomenon, how we think about how we speak <unk> how do we play <unk> are all questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, the questions about behavior are among the easy problems.
But the difficult problem is the question of why all the behavior is accompanied by an out-of-body experience.
And here it is, the standard paradigm of <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, doesn't still have a lot to say.
I'm a <unk> <unk>
I want a scientific theory of <unk> which works for a long time, hit my head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in pure terms of physical terms that would work.
But ultimately I came to the conclusion that that wasn't working for reasons.
I think we're going to lie at this point.
We have a marvelous explanations chain great. We get used to this, physics explains chemistry, chemistry explains biology explains biology, biology explains part of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit into this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we're conscious.
On the other, we don't know how to put that idea to our scientific vision of the world.
I think consciousness right now, it's kind of a <unk> something that we need to integrate our vision of the world, but we don't know yet.
With an anomaly, like this, you can need radical ideas, I think we need ideas that will be <unk> before we can deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today, has one.
His crazy idea is that there is no difficult problem of consciousness.
The whole idea of the subjective subjective film, includes a kind of illusion or confusion.
Actually, what you need to do, is to explain the functions -- the behaviors of the brain, the behaviors of the brain, and this is studies everything that needs to explanation.
Well, more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want a theory of purely <unk> consciousness based on the brain.
At the same time, for me and for many others, that vision is quite close to simply deny that the observation of consciousness is satisfying.
But I'm in a different direction.
In the time, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is critical.
And physicists sometimes take some aspects of the universe as the <unk> <unk> space and the mass.
<unk> fundamental laws that <unk> them like the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These laws and fundamental properties don't explain in terms of anything more basic.
Instead, they think of it, and that's where the world is built.
Sometimes, the list of the fundamental is <unk>
In the 19th century, <unk> found that you can't explain electric phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts -- space, time, mass, <unk> laws of <unk> and <unk> the electrical burden as a fundamental concept that those laws <unk>
I think that's the situation we find with consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas -- space time, time, mass, then a matter of logic, there is <unk> the list.
The most natural thing would be <unk> consciousness as a fundamental thing, a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that suddenly not the object of science.
It opens up the path to <unk> scientifically.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that connect consciousness with other fundamental concepts -- space, the mass, the mass, the mass, the mass, the mass processes.
And physicists sometimes say we want fundamental laws so simple that we can put them into a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find fundamental laws so simple we can put them into a t-shirt.
We still don't know what laws are, but that's what we're looking for.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Every system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes called <unk> <unk> by all, <unk> by mind, every system is aware, not only humans -- the dogs, the mice, the flies, even the microbes of Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are smart or <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be filled with heartbreak when you think, "Oh my God, you always travel at the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the <unk>
No, no.
But the thinking is that maybe photons can have an element of crude feeling, they would make some primitive precursor to consciousness.
This may sound a little bit crazy for you.
How do you think something so <unk>
Some of this comes from the first crazy idea that consciousness is most fundamental to you.
If it's fundamental as space and time and mass, it's natural to assume that it can also be universal, just like others.
It's also worth noticing that although the idea seems to us, it's much less for different cultures, where the human mind seems more a continuum of nature.
So a deeper reason comes from the idea that perhaps the simplest and powerful way of finding fundamental laws that will reflect the thinking with the physical process, is <unk> consciousness with information.
There's always information processing.
<unk> of complex <unk> like in a human being, physical consciousness.
<unk> of simple data, simple awareness.
Something very exciting is that in recent years, a <unk> <unk> <unk> took this kind of theory, and I developed it <unk> with mathematicians.
It has a mathematical measure of information, which is called <unk> which measures the degree of integrated information in a system.
And it's not supposed to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there is an incredible degree of information integration.
In a mouse there is a degree of information integration.
But when you get to the worms, microbes, particles, the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level of information integration is smaller, but it's not zero either.
In <unk> theory, there will still be a different awareness than zero.
Indeed, a fundamental law of <unk> <unk> high degree of consciousness.
Moreover, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate consciousness into the physical world.
<unk> and philosophers have often observed that physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using a lot of equations, but it doesn't talk about the reality underlying the reality underlies it.
How did Stephen Hawking, where does the fire come from?
From the <unk> view, the equations of physics can be allowed to be able to use to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, consciousness is the one that puts fire in the equations.
In that vision, consciousness is not outside of the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's right there.
This vision, I think, <unk> vision has the potential to <unk> our relationship to nature, and it can have social and ethical and ethical consequences.
Some of them can be <unk>
I used to think that I should not eat anything that I had consciousness, then it must be a <unk>
If you're a <unk> and you accept that vision, you'll get a lot of hunger.
I think thinking about it, this tends to transform your <unk> whereas what matters in terms of ethical and moral terms, not so much the fact of consciousness, but its importance and its complexity.
It's also natural for consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system of Samantha <unk>
It's <unk>
According to the vision of the information, she has a complicated information, integrated information, so the answer is, yes, if it's conscious.
If this is right, they have a rather serious ethical problems about the ethics of the development of intelligent computers and the ethical <unk>
Finally, you can ask for the collective collective consciousness, the planet.
Canada has its own consciousness?
Or a more local level, an integrated group as the audience in a TED Talk, and at this point, we have a TED collective consciousness -- an internal film, an inner film, different from the inner movies of each of the <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least is a question that you have to take seriously.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical vision, and I don't know if it's correct.
I'm actually more sure about the first crazy idea that consciousness is a fundamental thing that is a fundamental thing, which is universal.
The vision raises a lot of questions, many challenges, like, how those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex consciousness that we know and love it.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we're going to go on the right path to a theory of serious consciousness.
If not, well, probably this is the hardest problem of science and philosophy.
We can't wait to solve it overnight.
But I think we're finally going to figure out what we're going to do.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a small rural village in Victoria.
He had a very normal profile, a low education.
I went to school, I was obsessed with my friends, <unk> with my younger sisters.
It was all very normal.
And when I was 15, a member of my community came up to my parents because I wanted to <unk> for a prison prize.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice, but there's a silver problem.
She actually hasn't gotten anything."
I went to school, I had good grades. After school, I had an profile under my mother's <unk> and spent a lot of time looking at the <unk> series.
Yeah, I know. What contradiction.
But they were right.
I didn't do anything that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing that can be considered as a achievement if we take the disability out of the equation.
Years later, I was in the second part of teaching him in a high school school so only after about 20 minutes in the class, I had a guy lifted his hand up and said, "Hey, when give me your <unk>
And I said, "What <unk>
Well, I had been talking about the law of <unk> for about 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your <unk> <unk>
When people in chairs of wheels, they talk about <unk> things at school?"
"From the <unk> <unk>
And it was then when I realized, this child had had experiences with disabled people like inspiration.
And we don't know -- and it's not the fact that boy, I mean, that's true for many of us.
For us, people with disability are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We're not real people. We're there to inspire people.
And in fact, I'm on this <unk> scenario, what I do in this wheelchair, and you probably are waiting for you, right?  Yes.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I fear -- I fear <unk>
I'm not here for <unk>
I'm here to tell you that we lie in relation to disability.
Yes, they have been sold the lie that disability is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's a bad thing and living with a disability makes you remarkable.
It's not something wrong and doesn't make you remarkable.
And over the last few years, we've been able to spread even more this lie through social media media.
You may have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or this <unk> "Your excuse is <unk>
Or this <unk> "Before we <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there is a lot of them.
You may have seen one of the little girl without drawing with a pen held by the mouth.
You may have seen a kid running on carbon fiber <unk>
And there's a lot of these pictures, which are what we call <unk> <unk>
And I use the porn porn term -- because we brought a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, we hired the disabled to benefit from people with disabilities.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so we can see them and think, "Well, for very bad that my life might be worse.
I could be that person."
But if you are that person?
I've lost the account of the number of times that I've been dealing with strange <unk> to express that I think I am brave or a source of inspiration, and this was going to before my work had a public profile.
It was like I was getting up in the morning and remember my own name.  And this is <unk>
These images, those images, those images will include people with disability to benefit from people without disabilities.
They're there so you can see them and think that things are not so bad for you, or to put their concerns in perspective.
And life as disabled is actually something difficult.
So let's take a few things.
But the things that we come in, aren't the things that you can think.
They're not relative to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> <unk> because I was calling the so-called social model of disability, who tells us that we are more disabled because of the society that we live in because of our bodies or diagnostics.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very <unk> with him.
The things that I need to do, and I've learned to get the best of your ability as well as you do, and that's what happens with the children of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything outside the common.
They're simply using their bodies by taking the best of their ability.
So it's really fair to be in the way we do, by sharing those <unk>
When people say, "You're a source of <unk> it says it as <unk>
And I know why it happens.
It's because of the lie, because we have sold this lie that disability makes us remarkable.
And honestly it doesn't do it.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here -- the inspiration, and you think, <unk> <unk> you're not sometimes inspired by anything?"
And I actually know I am.
<unk> of other people with disability at all times.
However, I don't know that I'm cooler than them.
<unk> that this is a great idea to use <unk> <unk> to collect the things that fall over.  <unk> the clever clever trick of how to load your cell phone battery on the battery of the chair.
Great.
We learn about the force and resilience of others, we don't against our bodies and our <unk> but against a world that we <unk> and we <unk>
I really believe that that lie that we've sold us about disability is the biggest <unk>
It makes us hard life.
And that quote: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk> the reason that that's lie is because it's not true -- because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles in front of the stairs has never made it into a <unk>
Never.    <unk> in front of a television screen won't make the <unk> of the <unk>
Not a lot of people in the middle of a bookstore and <unk> a positive attitude to turn all those books into the <unk>
It's simply not going to happen.
I want to really live in a world where disability is not exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 15 year-old girl sitting in your bedroom looking at <unk> the <unk> <unk> is not considered <unk> nothing to be in a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have so low expectations of people with disability that we are going to be able to get out of bed and remember our names in the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value the genuine achievement of people with disabilities, and I want to live in a world where a child at 11 degree in a high school school in a school in <unk> is not a little surprised that your teacher is a <unk>
<unk> doesn't make us <unk> but question what you think to know about what you do.
Thank you.
What do you have to do is <unk> reality and professional football -- with <unk>
And what is the average speed of a <unk> <unk>
Unfortunately, I just respond to one of those questions, so please, not <unk>
When people think about <unk> they think about <unk> <unk> and in Tom <unk> hands hands in the air, but augmented reality is not science fiction.
<unk> reality is something that is going to happen in our days and happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to know it, because augmented reality will change our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So how did we get to reality?
The first step, is what I wear <unk> Google Google <unk>
I'm sure many of you are familiar with them.
What you may not know is that Google <unk> are a device that lets you see what I see.
They will allow them to experience what is a professional doctor in the countryside.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I tried to <unk>
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you would engage with your imagination.
We can use Google Glass, under a helmet and knowing what is running through the field of game to 160 blood <unk> the ear by hitting your ears.
We can know that it feels like a man of 110 pounds -- we were trying to get it out of all its being.
I've been there and I assure you, it's not nice.
So let's take some videos to show you what is using Google <unk> under the helmet, and give you a sense of that.
Unfortunately, they're not images of <unk> practices, because the idea of the emerging technology <unk> it's a submersible going up to the surface. But we do what we can.
So let's look at a video.
Chris <unk> Come on.
It's horrible to be <unk>
Just a moment. <unk> a little bit.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what is being <unk> in the football field, from the perspective of <unk>
You may have noticed that lack people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, <unk> from the University of Washington.
<unk> from <unk> mice.
Blue 8, Blue <unk> Go!
Chris <unk> This gives you a little bit more about the field, but it has nothing to do with being in the <unk>
<unk> want that experience.
The fans want to be in the field, will be their favorite players, and have asked me on YouTube and <unk> "You can see from the angle of a field <unk>

We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how do we go from <unk> how we put it to the next <unk>
We took it to that level using something called <unk> <unk> that probably many people already know.
The <unk> <unk> has been described as the most realistic virtual reality apparatus ever created, and it's not <unk>
And I'm going to show you why why with this video.
Man: Oh, dear.
No, no, no! I don't want to keep <unk> No!
Oh, my God! Ah!
<unk> That is the experience of a man on a rollercoaster <unk> for his life.
What will be the experience of a fan when you put a video of Adrian <unk> across the line, <unk> from a <unk> with the arm before running and making a <unk> What will be the experience of a fan of a fan of <unk>
When he can be <unk> running through the <unk> throwing the ball into the bottom of the network?
What will your experience when you get from a mountain to over 100 miles as a <unk> <unk>
Maybe the marriage <unk> <unk>
But this is not still <unk>
It's only virtual reality, <unk>
How do we achieve <unk> <unk>
It <unk> augmented reality, when the <unk> the <unk> and the owners see the information that people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to win <unk>
Because they always use technology to gain.
They like to gain. Give them money.
So, here's a quick refresher on technology in <unk>
In <unk> the Baltimore <unk> put a <unk> to his field <unk> to play faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to do it.
More people saw the party because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, the <unk> put radios on the <unk> of <unk> and then in the <unk>
They had more viewers because it was faster, they fun.
In <unk> imagine that they're a player coming back to your group, and you see your next big move in front of you, in a plastic bombsight that you have in front of you, you don't have to worry about to forget about a <unk>
or to memorize the strategy.
It just comes out to the field and <unk>
And the coaches want it, because if they don't follow their instructions, they lose <unk> and they hate to lose games.
If you lose parties as a coach.
And they don't want that.
But augmented reality is not just a manual <unk>
<unk> reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your form of playing the game.
How would it be done?
Well, a very simple option would be to have a camera in every single corner of the stadium -- having a view from the top of the people that's down.
You also get information from the <unk> sensors and the <unk> something that is already working on.
And all that information you send to your <unk>
The good teams will know <unk>
Bad people will have <unk> of information.
This is going to make good teams of the bad guys.
So your computer team is going to be as important as your <unk> and the data analysis is going to stop being just for <unk>
It's also going to be <unk> Who would have <unk>
How would it be in the country?
Imagine that you are <unk>
They got the ball and <unk>
I went to an open channels, and a lot of a sudden, on the left side of your bombsight -- you would give you a defense behind you is going to <unk> Normally, you don't know it, but the system of <unk> will be <unk>
They went to the protection.
Another <unk> will be <unk> there is an open fight.
You get the <unk> but you <unk>
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where to land yet, the receptor sees its bombsight -- an area of grass that lights up and can modify the race.
It <unk> <unk> <unk> runs and <unk>
The cool audience and the fans have followed it from every angle.
This is something that will create massive excitement on the game.
I'm going to do a lot of people see it, because people want to live that experience.
The fans want to be in the ground.
They want to be your favorite player.
<unk> reality will be part of the sport because it's too profitable to not be.
But what I ask you, we want this is the only use of reality <unk>
We're going to use it just as bread and <unk> like our <unk> entertainment.
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use augmented reality to foster empathy among human beings, to show someone how it's literally being in the other person's place.
We know what this technology is worth <unk>
It generates billions of income a year.
But how much is this technology worth for a professor in the classroom trying to show a <unk> how bad are their actions from the perspective of <unk>
How much is this technology worth in Uganda or Russia to try to show the world how it lives to be <unk>
How much is also worth a <unk> or an Neil <unk> <unk> trying to inspire a generation of children to think more in space and science rather than <unk> notes and <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, the augmented reality gets close.
The questions that we do, the decisions we take and the challenges that we face, <unk> as always, as usual.
Thank you.
I was recently, after 23 years of service in the <unk> <unk> of California.
Most of those 23 years of the country was <unk> the southern tip of <unk> County that includes the Golden Golden <unk>
The bridge is a <unk> structure known by its beautiful view of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean.
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for suicide, being one of the most used places in the world.
The Golden Gate Bridge was opened in <unk>
Joseph <unk> engineer the chief chief resident to build the bridge, said that, "The bridge is virtually <unk>
<unk> from the bridge is not practical and <unk>
But from its openness, over 1,600 people have jumped to their death from that bridge.
Some of them believe that traveling between the two towers will take it to another dimension, this bridge has been <unk> as such, so that every ever since he frees you from all your concerns and pain, and the waters that pass under <unk> your soul.
But let me tell you that happens when the bridge is used to commit suicide.
After one <unk> of four to five seconds, the body hits about 120 miles an hour.
The impact breaks the bones, some of which we have vital organs.
Most of them die in the impact.
The ones that don't normally get rid of in the water and then <unk>
I don't think that we have this method of suicide is going to realize the <unk> the death of the <unk>
This is the wire.
Except around the two towers, there's 32 inches of steel steel to the bridge.
This is where most people get to before they get their lives.
I can tell you for experience that once the person is on that edge, and in its darkest time, it's very difficult to bring them back.
I took this picture last year while this young man talking to a officer looking his life.
I want to tell you very glad that we were successful that day to bring it back on the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we didn't have any formal training.
<unk> to channel the way through these calls.
This was not just a bad service to those who spent the suicide, but the officers as well.
We've come a long way since then.
Today, medical officials and psychologists train into the new government.
This is Jason <unk>
I met this last year from July last year when I got a call of an possible subject suicide bomber sitting in the <unk>
<unk> and when I got there, I looked at Jason talking to an officer of the Golden Golden <unk>
Jason was just 32 years old and he had flown up here from New Jersey.
In fact, it had flown up to here two times before New Jersey to try to commit suicide from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to <unk> we asked if we knew the story of the box of <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> created <unk> and sent it to the Earth with a box, and he said, <unk> never open that <unk>
Well, one day, the curiosity could more than <unk> and she opened the box.
And of course, they came out <unk> <unk> and all kinds of <unk> against man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
So Jason said, "What happens if you open the box and there's no <unk>
He stopped about <unk> leaned on the right, and he left.
This guy kind of nice and smart guy in New Jersey just got out of the life.
I talked to the parents of Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, it didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day, the family of the family called me to see what I was.
The parents of Jason had order.
<unk> damage to a lot of people.
I put them up to these questions: what would you do if a member of your family, a friend or someone loved to be <unk>
What about <unk>
What do you say?
In my experience, it's not just to speak, but you have to listen to it.
Listening to understand.
You don't want to be <unk> or say to the person you know how it feels like, because they probably won't.
And just being there, you can be the turning point that they need.
If you think that somebody is <unk> you don't have to be afraid of <unk> and ask the question.
One way to ask you the question is: <unk> in similar circumstances have been thinking about how to end life, you've had these <unk>
<unk> the person in front of it can save the life and be the inflection point for them.
Other signs to <unk> despair, believe that things are terrible, and they never go to <unk> <unk> to believe that there is nothing that you can do by <unk> social isolation, and a lost interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days, and I got an email from a lady and I'd like to read you your letter.
She lost his son on January 19, this year, and he wrote this email just a couple of days, and he is with her permission and blessing that I read it.
"Hi, <unk> I guess you're at the TED conference.
It must be a whole experience to be there.
I'm thinking that I should go foot to the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to your friends who tell your friends, etc.
I'm still quite <unk> but noticing more moments to realize that Mike didn't go home.
Mike was driving from <unk> to San Francisco to see the <unk> party.
He never got there.
I called the police of <unk> and <unk> it like disappeared that night.
The next morning, two officers came to my house, and they reported me that the Mike <unk> car was down in the bridge.
A witness I had seen him jump from the bridge to the <unk> in the late day.
Thank you very much for fighting for those who may be temporarily too much to fight themselves.
Who hasn't been wrong without having true mental illness.
It shouldn't be so easy to end with it.
My prayers are with you for your struggle.
The <unk> the Golden Golden Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful bay, not a <unk>
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and walk the way her son took that day, and also the value to go forward.
I'd like to introduce you to a man that I mean with hope and value.
On March 11 of March 2005, I wrote to a radio call for an possible subject, subject to the sidewalk sidewalk near the northern tower.
I took my bike. I looked at this guy, and I looked at this man, Kevin <unk> standing on the sidewalk.
When I saw me, he immediately saw the <unk> and stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
Over the next time, I heard about Kevin talked about his depression and despair.
Kevin decided to see that day coming back over that lane and give life another opportunity.
And when Kevin came back to him, he turned to him.
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I asked him, "What did he do that he <unk> and gave the hope for the life and my life <unk>
And you know what she told me?
He said, "I <unk>
He stopped talking and just <unk>
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from the mother of Kevin, and I have that letter with me, and I would like to <unk>
"Dear Mr. <unk> Nothing erase the events at 11 in March, and you're one of the reasons that Kevin is still with us.
Honestly, I think Kevin was <unk> for help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental illness for which it has been properly <unk>
<unk> to Kevin when I was only six months, completely unconscious, from all those traits -- <unk> but, thank God, we now know that.
Kevin is in order, as he says.
We thank God for you.
I really do in debt with you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end of it, he writes -- <unk> When I visited San Francisco at the San Francisco that night, you would take out like the patient.
<unk> I know I had to <unk>
Today, Kevin is a <unk> father.
It talks openly about the events of that day and their depression with hope that their story inspire others.
<unk> is not just something I've been found at work.
It's personal.
My grandfather got a poison.
That act, despite finishing their own pain, my own opportunity to meet him.
This is what suicide.
For most people <unk> or those who consider suicide, they wouldn't think about hurt somebody else.
They just want their own pain.
Usually this is achieved by three things: sleep, drugs or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've responded and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illness and <unk> around the bridge.
From those incidents that I've been directly involved involved -- I've only lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who talked about about an hour.
During that time, I got her hand at three times.
In the end, I looked at me, and he said, "I'm sorry, but I have to go."
And they <unk>
<unk> absolutely awful.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of the people that we get to contact on that bridge is not <unk>
Also, those few that have jumped out of the bridge and lived and that you can talk about it, that one percent or two percent, most of those people have said that the second ones that stop side the railing realized they had made a mistake and wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge doesn't only connect to San Francisco, but also the people.
That connection, or bridge that we do, is something that all of us and every one of us should be striving to do.
<unk> you can prevent.
There's help. There's hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you be what you don't are, but in your inner you know what you are, and a question is, how do you feel about that?
I have to be something unique in that sense, but I'm not alone, in any way I'm alone.
When I became a model I felt that I finally had the dream that I had since I had since I was a child.
My outside finally stepped into my inner truth, with my inner self.
For reasons for reasons that I'm going to refer to later, when I look at this picture -- I think, <unk> <unk> <unk>
But the last October, I discovered that, <unk> I'm just starting.
We all <unk> our families, our religion, our society, our moment in history, even our bodies.
Some of them have the value of <unk> to get rid of the limitations of the skin or because of the beliefs of those of us around us.
These are people who are always challenging the status quo, which is considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years, many of my neighbors -- many of my friends, my even ignored agent of my story.
I think this puzzle is called <unk>
This is mine.
I was recorded as <unk> when I was born because of the appearance of my <unk>
I remember my five years in the Philippines, in my house, I was always wearing this shirt on my head.
And my mom said, "Why are you always wearing that shirt in <unk>
I said, "Mom, that's my hair. I'm a <unk>
I knew how to <unk>
The gender has always been considered a <unk> but now we know that it's actually more complex and <unk>
Because of my success, I never asked me to share my story, not because it thought that I am a bad thing, but because of how the world deals with those of us who want to <unk>
Every day I appreciate being a woman.
I have a mama, my dad and a family who take me as I am.
Many are not so lucky.
There's a long tradition in the <unk> culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
There's a <unk> goddess of <unk>
And when I was eight years old, I was at a party in the Philippines who celebrated these mysteries.
I was standing in front of the stage and I remember this beautiful woman appeared to me, and I remember that moment as if something <unk> I want to be.
And when I was 15, when I was still wearing a man, I met this woman called <unk>
It's the head of a contest of beauty <unk>
That night she asked me, "Why haven't you've been involved in the <unk> competition.
He told me that if I was <unk> she was responsible for <unk> and <unk> and that night, he won in suit, he won in <unk> and I was a third finalist among over 40 candidates.
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was inside the world of beauty.
Not many people can say that their first job was queen of beauty of women, but I know I can.
I also met the goddess of <unk> especially when I was <unk> to remote provinces of the Philippines.
But more importantly, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001, my mom.
I was <unk>
I said to my mother, "Mommy, I'm <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a queen <unk>
But then, two weeks later, he called me and said, "You know if you get to the United States, you can change the name and the identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested to put two <unk> to my name.
She also accompanied me when I was standing in Thailand when I was in Thailand to age 19.
It's curious that in some of the most rural cities in Thailand do the most sophisticated surgeries that are sophisticated and secure.
At that time in the United States, it was necessary to be done the surgery before the name and gender.
So in 2001 I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the license license with the name of <unk> and <unk>
It was a great time.
For some people, their identity paper means being able to drive or be able to get a <unk> but for me it was the license to live, to feel <unk>
Suddenly, my fears saw <unk>
I felt I could conquer my dream and move to New York, and be model.
Many are not so lucky.
I think of this woman <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman in New York who had lived his truth, but he <unk> his life.
For many of my community, that's the reality they live.
Our rates of suicide are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
All 20 of November we make a waking waking thing by <unk> Day.
I'm on this stage thanks to a long story of people who are <unk> and stood up to injustice.
These are Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
Today, right now, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't continue to live my truth and just me.
I want to do the best to help others to live their truth without shame, or fear.
I'm here, <unk> so that one day there is no more <unk> than 20 <unk>
My deeper truth led me to accept what I am.
Do you?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you.  <unk> <unk> <unk> a quick question.
<unk> <unk> Right. <unk> -- first of all, thank you for all my <unk>
my parents' network, my parents especially, to my family, who is very strong.
I remember all the times that I've been to young women who have been <unk> and sometimes when they were called me and told me that their parents could not embrace it, I would take the phone and say, "Mommy, can you call this <unk>
Sometimes it worked -- it's not a gender identity, that's what is in the center of what we are, right?
I mean, we all assigned a gender to birth, and what I try to do is put on the table -- the subject that sometimes that task didn't block and that there should be a space that would allow people, and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
The <unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
It should have understanding.
There should be space for curiosity and to ask questions, and I hope that all of you are my allies.
KS: Thank you. Very kind. Thank you.
In many societies, and tribal societies, parents are usually familiar with their kids, but I'm one of the few parents who are known for his daughter and I'm proud of it.
<unk> began his campaign by defending his rights in 2007. And when they were <unk> their efforts in 2011, the National Prize <unk> became very <unk> a very popular girl in their country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but now I'm his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you take a look at the history of humanity, the story of the women is the story of the <unk> of inequality, of violence and exploitation.
You see, in <unk> societies, right from the beginning, when when you're born a child, their birth will not be <unk>
It's not welcome and his father and his mother.
The neighborhood comes back, it gives her <unk> to mother and nobody <unk> the father.
And a mother got a lot of a mother to get a little girl.
When it gives birth to the first child, the first daughter, gets sad.
When it gives birth to the second daughter, <unk> and with the hope of a son, when he <unk> his third daughter, he feels guilty as a criminal.
Not just the suffering, but the daughter <unk> when it grows, he suffers from too.
At the age of five years, when I should go to school, it stays at home and school admits of his siblings.
Even the age of 12 years, in a way, has a good life.
It can be <unk>
It can play with your friends on the street, and it can move along the streets as a butterfly.
But when it comes into adolescence, when it is 13 years old, he gets to get out of his house without a male <unk>
It's confined to the four walls of their house.
It's no longer a person.
It becomes the honor of his father and his brothers and his family, and if he was <unk> the code of that honor -- he could even kill.
And it's interesting that this of honor code, not only the life of a <unk> also affects the lives of male members in the family.
So this brother, <unk> the joys of his life and the happiness of his sisters in the name of honor.
And there's a standard more norm than the <unk> societies, which is called <unk>
It's supposed to be very <unk> and very <unk> and very <unk>
It's the judgment.
The model of a good girl must be <unk>
It's supposed to be silent and accepting the decisions of their father and their mother and decisions of the elderly and the decisions of the elderly even if they don't.
If you put it with a man who doesn't like it, or if you put it with an old man, it has to be <unk> because he doesn't want to be <unk>
If the very young one, it has to embrace it.
Otherwise, the <unk> <unk>
And what happens to the end?
In the words of a <unk> "The <unk> <unk> and then give birth to more children and <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson of <unk> his daughter and the same lesson of honor to his children.
And this vicious cycle goes on, and it goes on.
<unk> brothers and sisters, when he was born, and for the first time, believe me, I don't like the newborns, to be honest, but when I was there and looked at his eyes, believe me, I felt extremely <unk>
And so much before I was thinking, I thought about his name, and I was fascinated with a <unk> <unk> of the freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> <unk> and he called my daughter so for her.
But when I was older, they were all men, and I grabbed my pen, and I would take a line from my name, and I wrote, <unk>
And when she grew, when she was four and a half years old, I was <unk> in my school.
So you might ask, why should I mention a little girl in a school?
Yeah, I should be <unk>
They can take it for granted in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in the poor world, in the tribal societies, in tribal societies, it's a great event for life life.
<unk> in a school means the recognition of his identity and his name.
<unk> to school means that it's in the world of dreams and the aspirations where it can explore their potential for their future life.
I have five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and they would be <unk> two weeks before, when I was <unk> the form of visa Canadian and he was in the relative part of the family, I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason I had never seen the names of my sisters written in any document.
That was the reason that the value of my daughter.
What my father couldn't give my sisters and his daughters, thought he had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and the <unk> of my daughter.
And then he <unk> to sit with me when my friends came to me.
The encouraged to go with me to different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried to get them into their personality.
And this was not just for her, just for <unk>
I've got all of these good values in my school to girls and kids alike.
I used education to <unk>
<unk> my daughters, taught the students, to forget the lesson of <unk>
They taught the students to forget the lesson of the so-called <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, sisters, for more rights and <unk> to have more and more space for women in society.
But we found ourselves a new phenomenon.
It was lethal for human rights and in particular, for women's rights.
It was called <unk>
That means a complete denial of women's participation in all of the economic and social activities and social activities.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
Girls go to school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and stopped going to markets.
The musicians were <unk> the <unk> girls and the singers were killed.
<unk> millions, but a few <unk> and it was scary to have around those people who kill and <unk> when you speak for their rights.
It's really frightening.
At the age of 10 years, he got up and got up for the right to education.
He wrote a newspaper from the BBC, on the BBC, he was offered her herself for New York Times, and he talked about every platform that he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
It <unk> like a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason why the Taliban could not tolerate her campaign and the <unk> October 2012, he was shot to <unk> in his head.
It was a day <unk> for my family and me.
The world became a big black hole.
Whereas my daughter was <unk> between life and death, he would get her back to my <unk> "I must <unk> for what happened to my daughter, <unk>
And <unk> said to me, "Please don't <unk>
<unk> the fair cause.
I think of your life in play because of the cause of the peace, and by the cause of education, and by the cause of education, and your daughter was inspired by you and <unk>
Both were on the right path and God <unk>
These little word <unk> a lot to me, and I didn't go back again.
When I was <unk> I was in the hospital, and he had severe <unk> and strong headaches because his facial nerve was cut, I used to see a dark shadow that was taken off the face of my wife.
But my daughter never <unk>
I used to say, "I'm fine with my <unk> smile, and with the <unk> on my face.
I'm going to be fine. Please <unk>
It was a comfort for us, and it was <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, have learned from her how to resist the hardest moments, and I'm very pleased to share with you that despite being an icon for the children and the women, it's like any 16 year-old girl.
<unk> when he didn't just work.
They were fighting with their brothers, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What is there especially in my tutoring <unk> who has made so bold to <unk> so brave and expressive and <unk>
I mean, I'm not wondering what I did.
<unk> what I didn't do.
I didn't cut their wings and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
I was <unk> of the brain 18 years ago, and since that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion for me.
I'm engineering.
And I want to tell you that I've recently joined the <unk> group of Google, where I've had a <unk> to my <unk> the <unk> of Google <unk> But all the work I'm talking about today about the science of the brain, I did it before I joined Google or outside my work there.
Having said this, there is a stigma when you get into a brain surgery.
You're still just like smart or not?
If you don't, you'll be able to be <unk>
After the <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't gray, but it was the dead part of the center that creates important hormones and <unk>
Immediately after the operation, I had to decide how much to take, from more than a dozen powerful chemicals every day, because if I didn't take anything, would die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I've had to decide the combinations and chemistry chemistry and try to convince them to stay alive.
More than once I've been saved by me.
But, luckily, I have soul of <unk> so I decided I would try to try to get the doses of <unk> because there is no clear map that says it in <unk>
I began to try and mix with different <unk> and I was amazed by seeing how small changes in the doses of the world's dramatically <unk> my sense of who I, my behavior with each other.
A particularly <unk> case for a few months, and I tried a typical chemical dose for a twentieth man and I was surprised to see how I would take my thoughts.
I was always <unk> I thought all the time in sex, and I thought it was the smartest person around the world, and --  --  -- of course, a lot of times in the past I've met several kinds of guys, or maybe some versions of it.
It turned out as a extreme.
But my big surprise was that I wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, it was <unk> a little bit of <unk> fixing a problem I had in front of it, and it just didn't happen.
So I couldn't handle it.
I changed my <unk>
But I think that experience gave me a new appreciation of the men and what they have to do, since then I am getting better with men.
So what was trying to do about how to adjust those hormones and <unk> and so on, it was <unk> my intelligence after disease and <unk> my creative thinking, my flow of ideas.
<unk> thinking almost always in pictures, and that became the key point of the key <unk> how to get those images that I use to create <unk> my ideas, if you were <unk> new ideas and <unk> situations.
This kind of thoughts is not new.
<unk> as <unk> Descartes and <unk> see things in the same way.
They thought images and mental ideas were the same thing.
Today there are people who challenge this idea, and there are so many discussions about how the minds works, for me it's simple: for most of us, the images of mental imagery are fundamental to design thinking, and <unk>
So after several years, I got to find the point right now, and I have lots of great <unk> mental <unk> really, really <unk> and <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to take well quickly these mental images, of my mind to the computer screen.
Can you imagine what would happen if a film director would be able to use their imagination only to steer the world that has the <unk>
Or if a musician could extract the music of your head?
There are incredible possibilities with this, as the way that people creative people can get to share the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty to do this is simply to increase the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
Let me show you why I think we're pretty close to this with two recent experiments that were done by two groups leading up in neuroscience.
Both of them used MRI technology, image functional MRI, to represent the brain scan that you can see by <unk> <unk> and his colleagues from Harvard.
The column on the left shows the scan of the brain of a person who looks at an image.
The middle of the brain shows the scan of the brain of that same individual as you were looking at that same image.
The column on the right was created <unk> the contents of the central column on the left -- you see that the difference is almost <unk>
This is <unk> in many different individuals with lots of different images, always with a similar outcome.
The difference between seeing an image and imagine looking at that same image.
Now, let me share with you another experiment. This is from the Jack lab in Berkeley, California.
They were able to turn the brain waves in visual visual fields.
Let's put it in this way.
In this experiment, I showed people hundreds of hours of YouTube videos while they were <unk> their brains to create a big pool of brain reactions to the video video.
Then I showed you a movie with new images, new animals, new animals, and as well as a new <unk>
The computer using just the brain data scanning to show you what it seemed like the person was seeing.
On the right you can see the <unk> of the computer, and on the left, the video that I showed you.
This blew us up.
We're right about doing it.
We just need to make the resolution.
And now, remember, when you look at an image and when you imagine that same picture, you create in the brain the same <unk>
This led to the <unk> brain system, available today, and their resolution has gone into a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase the resolution a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How do you <unk>
There's a lot of techniques to do it.
One is open the skull and introduce electrodes.
I don't offer me to that.
And so many of them are proposing new techniques to projection for images, even I am, with the recent outcome of MRI -- first we have to ask the question, this technology is going to be the end of the <unk>
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get more resolution, is with bigger magnets -- but at this point, the more <unk> magnets only offer small improvements in resolution, not by thousands as we need.
I propose this idea: instead of big magnets. Let's make better magnets.
We can create much more complex structures with slightly different returns, like making a <unk>
And why does this matter?
In the last few years, a great amount of effort in MRI was to make really big magnets -- right?
But most recent advances in the recent advances in <unk> and brilliant solutions.
Instead, instead of a magnetic field, including chemical patterns structured in the frequencies of radio radio frequencies.
So when we combine the magnetic patterns with the patterns of the radio radio processing processing processing processing, we can actually increase the information that you can extract in a single <unk>
Also, we can then split into layers our increasing knowledge about the structure of the brain and the memory to create the increase in the thousands that we need.
By using <unk> we should be able to measure not only blood fluid -- but the <unk> hormones that I mentioned and perhaps even the direct neural activity -- this is the dream.
We're going to be able to put our ideas into a direct form of digital media.
Can you imagine if we could go beyond language and communicate directly through the <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how do we learn to deal with the truths of human thinking without <unk>
You thought the Internet is a big thing.
These are great questions.
It would be irresistible as a tool to amplify our design skills and communication.
Certainly, this same tool could lead to the cure of Alzheimer's and similar diseases.
We have few options more than open up this door.
So anyway, pick a year to happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine that it'll take much more.
We have to learn how to take this step together.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you tonight about getting out of the closet, and not just a traditional sense, not just the gay closet.
I think we all have <unk>
Their closet is probably telling some person for the first time you love it, or tell someone you're pregnant, or say to someone who has cancer, or any other difficult conversation that you have ever gotten through in life.
So everything is a difficult conversation, and even though our issues can vary <unk> the experience of having lived and have come out of that closet is universal.
It's fear, and we don't like that.
Many years ago, I was working on the South Side of <unk> <unk> a restaurant in the city, and being there, I had to go through several phases of the intensity of the <unk> <unk> <unk> my armpits was going to quote the letters of <unk> <unk> <unk> as a <unk>
And I will be slope that by the <unk> of my <unk> and I had <unk> my head I was just asked by a kid -- "Hey, you're a kid or <unk>
And it would appear very awkward silence at the table.
<unk> my jaw a little closer, I would take my coffee with a <unk>
The father <unk> <unk> the newspaper and mother tossed a cold.
But I would not say anything, and <unk> out there.
And I got to the point that every time I was going to a place where there was a child between three and 10 years, I was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised myself that next time I would say something.
I should have that hard conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened again.
"You're a guy or a <unk>
A familiar silence, but this time I was prepared and I was just about to come up with female issues, on the table.  I had the quotes of Betty <unk>
<unk> <unk>
Even a fragment of the "Vagina Monologues," which <unk>
And then I took a breath down and went down and go and look at my backs and my backs up a little girl in four years with a pink dress looking at what is not a challenge for a three-year-old <unk> just a girl with a question: "You're <unk>
And then I took a deep breath, again, I got <unk> close to her, and I said, "Hey, I know this is confusing here.
I have the short hair like a boy, and I saw a kid, but I am a girl, and you know, like you like to use a pink dress and sometimes you like to use a comfortable pajamas.
OK, I'm more of the kind of girl of a fellow <unk>
And that girl looked at me <unk> <unk> and he said, "My favorite <unk> is <unk> and it has a fish.
Can you give me a <unk> for <unk>
And that was it. I just "Ah, <unk> You're just a girl.
What about the <unk> <unk>
It was the easiest conversation to ever ever had.
And by <unk> because the girl of <unk> and I, both of us were <unk> one with the other.
So as many of us, I've lived in some <unk> in my life, and yes, my walls used to be a <unk>
But inside, in the dark, you can't know what color is the walls.
You just know how it feels like living in a closet.
That's how my closet is not different from yours or yours or yours.
<unk> I'll give you a hundred reasons why coming out of my closet was more difficult than coming out of it, but this is the <unk> It's not <unk>
The hard thing is hard.
Who can tell me that explain to someone who have declared banking is harder to say it's been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story that I tell is harder than telling your five-year-old son that you're going to be <unk>
There's no more difficult, there is only the hard.
We need to stop classifying what is difficult to do with what it is difficult to make other people better to make us feel better or worse in relation to our arguments, and we must just feel empathy because we all live something hard.
At some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and you can make security, or at least security that you offer the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that no matter what your walls are made -- a closet is not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine yourself 20 years ago.
And I, he had a horse and a horse and <unk> shoes.
It wasn't the militant girl prepared to fight any child in four years that would walk into the coffee.
I was frozen by fear, <unk> in a corner of my dark closet <unk> my <unk> and the move only a muscle is the easiest thing ever ever done.
My family, my friends, complete strangers who have spent my entire life trying to not <unk> and now the world would turn around purpose.
I was burning the pages of a script that we've all followed for so long, but if you don't release that <unk> you will kill.
One of my most memorable stripes, was more memorable was my sister.
It was the first time that many of the guests knew that I was gay, and by making my wife <unk> <unk> in my black dress and <unk> walked around the tables and finally came to one where my parents were, the friends of my parents, people who knew me years ago.
And after talking a moment, one of the women, I yelled forward to Nathan <unk>
And the battle of the gay story had begun.
<unk> you ever were in the <unk>
"Well, yeah, the truth is, we have friends in San <unk>
"Well, we've never gone there, but we've heard it <unk>
<unk> you know my <unk> <unk>
It's very good, and it's never talked about having <unk>
So what is your favorite TV show in?
Our favorite sciences, Will Grace <unk>
And you know who <unk> us <unk>
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but hopefully desperately to show her support, to make me know that I was on my side, he finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband uses shirt <unk>
And I had an opportunity at that time, as you have all the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> might have been easy to indicate where they felt <unk>
It's not very difficult to find them and realize the fact that they were <unk>
And what else can you ask someone, but <unk>
If you're going to be authentic with somebody, you have to be prepared for the authentic things that we want.
That's how hard conversations do not be my strong point.
Ask anybody with the ones I have <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I follow what I like to call the three principles of <unk>
Now, please look at this through the <unk> perspective, but understand that what it involves coming out of any closet is essentially the same.
Number one: Be authentic.
<unk> <unk> Be yourself.
That girl in the cafe had no armor but I was ready for the battle.
If you want someone to be <unk> the others must know that we also suffer.
Number two: Be direct <unk> simply <unk> your <unk>
If you know that they are gay, <unk>
If they tell their parents that maybe they might be gay, they will maintain the hope that that could change.
Don't give them a sense of false hope.
And number three, and more important --  Let the complex.
You communicate their truth.
It would never be done by that.
And some of you can come out of them who are injured safe, <unk> by what they've done, but I'm never sorry for what they are.
And yeah, maybe some of you feel <unk> but that's something in them, not in you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not your own.
That's the story of them, but not from you.
The only story that matters is what you want to write.
So the next time you find out in a dark closet <unk> a <unk> you must know that we've all been there before.
And you may feel very alone, but they don't.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
So what is that?
If you look at the story of what the intelligence has seen as a productive example -- it's been the famous quote by <unk> <unk> that the question if a machine can think of this is as interesting as the question of whether a submersible can <unk>
When <unk> <unk> wrote this as a criticism.
And so, a few years ago, I took a program to try to understand the fundamental physical mechanisms of intelligence.
Let's take a step.
We first start with a thought experiment.
Imagine that you're from an alien race that you don't know about the biology of the Earth or neuroscience of the Earth and the Earth of the Earth, but they have incredible telescopes and you can see the Earth, and they have incredibly long lives, so you can see the Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as <unk> we know that the reason would be that we're trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you're from a alien race that doesn't know anything about this, that it doesn't have any concept about intelligence on Earth, you'd be forced to develop a physical theory that would explain how, to a certain time in time, the asteroids that we <unk> the surface of a planet.
And so I claim that this is the same question that understanding the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that led several years ago, I looked at a variety of issues through science, through various disciplines, I think, to a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there have been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be accurately honed for the development of intelligence, and in particular, for the development of the universal states that replace the diversity of potential future.
Finally, in the robotic movement, there have been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the skills of robots to maximize future freedom in order to perform complex tasks.
And so, taking all of these different issues and <unk> together, I said, since several years ago, there's an underlying mechanism for the intelligence we can extract from all these different <unk>
Is there just an equation for <unk>
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the closest equivalent of a E = <unk> for the intelligence that I have ever seen.
So what you're seeing here is an affirmation that intelligence is an artist's force, which acts in order to maximize the future freedom of action.
It was acting to maximize the future freedom of action, or maintain the open options, with a force -- with a force -- with the diversity of possible future accessible, yes, even an impending future, <unk>
In short, the intelligence doesn't like to stay <unk>
The intelligence is trying to maximize the future freedom of action and maintain our options open.
And so, having in account this equation, it's natural to asking, what can you do with this?
How <unk> is it?
It monitors the level of human intelligence.
<unk> artificial intelligence.
So I'm going to show you now a video that I think, to show some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research research has suggested that the universes that produce more mess, or <unk> during their life should have trend in more favorable conditions for the existence of intelligent beings like us.
But what if that <unk> connection is between entropy and intelligence -- a more <unk> relationship.
What happens if the intelligent behavior is not only correlates with the production of entropy -- but it actually emerges directly from her?
To find out, we've developed a software engine called <unk> which is designed to maximize the overall entropy of entropy -- in any system that you find inside.
Amazingly, <unk> could happen multiple evidence of animal intelligence, play games, and even making money <unk> actions, all of that without the fact that it would have been right to do that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Just like a human standing without <unk> here we see <unk> <unk> automatically a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable in part because we never gave it a goal.
He just decided to balance the <unk>
This ability to balance have applications for the humanoid robotics and human programs.
This ability to use tools will have applications in intelligent manufacturing and agriculture.
Also, just like some other animals can cooperate pulling opposite ends of one rope at the same time to release the food, here we see that <unk> can do a version of the model of that task.
This ability to cooperation has interesting consequences for economic planning and in a variety of other fields.
<unk> is widely applicable in a variety of <unk>
For example, here we see this successfully playing a game of <unk> against itself, <unk> their potential for play.
So here we see <unk> orchestrate new connections into a social network where the friends are constantly getting up and maintain the network right now.
This same network capacity also has applications on health care, energy and intelligence.
So here we see <unk> organizing the routes of a fleet of ships, discovering successfully and using the Panama Canal to expand the global level to the Pacific.
In the same way, <unk> is widely applicable in defense and logistics and transportation.
Finally, here we see <unk> spontaneously discovering and running a strategy of <unk> <unk> in a series of manual negotiation -- successfully increasing assets under their exponentially.
This ability for risk management is going to have huge applications in finance and safe.
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of marks of human cognitive brands such as use tools, walking upright and social cooperation -- all derive from a single equation, that leads to a system to maximize its future freedom of action.
Now, here's a deep <unk>
Let's go back at the beginning of the term <unk> the <unk> work there was always the concept that if we were going to make smart machines that would have a <unk> rebellion, there would be <unk>
Machines got against us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe all of these decades, we have had the whole concept of rebellion, in reverse.
It's not that the machines first become smart and then <unk> and try to take over the world.
It's all the opposite, that the urge to take control of every single future is a more fundamental principle than the intelligence that general intelligence can actually come directly from taking control, rather than being backwards.
Another important consequence is the search for goal.
They often ask me, how do you look for targets learn from this kind of <unk>
My equivalent to that statement to go to the descendants of them to help them build artificial intelligence or to help them understand human intelligence, is this: intelligence must be seen as a physical process that is trying to maximize the future freedom of action and avoid constraints in their own future.
Thank you very much.
We're at an inflection point in human history, something between the rise of stars and losing the planet that we call <unk>
Except, in the last few years, we've extended a lot of our knowledge of how the Earth fits into the context of the universe.
The Kepler Medical mission has discovered thousands of possible planets orbiting other stars, which points to the Earth is only one between the billions of planets from our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope which measures the faint <unk> intensity of stars when the planets go ahead of them, and they block a little bit of that light to us.
The data gathered up by Kepler shows the sizes of planets in addition to the distance that there is between them and their star star.
Together, it helps us to understand whether these planets are small and <unk> like the Earth planets from our solar system, and also the amount of light that they receive from their suns.
Instead, this is clues about whether these planets that we find are habitable or not.
Unfortunately, while we're finding this treasure. of potentially <unk> worlds our own planet is rooted under the weight of humanity.
<unk> year was the hottest <unk>
<unk> and sea ice that have been with us for the millennia, now they're disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that we've moved on on a global scale, has moved rapidly our ability to disrupt its course.
But I'm not a weather scientist, and I'm not <unk>
But I study the <unk> of the planet influenced by the stars, with hope to find places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
You could say that I'm looking for alien opportunities in the property sector.
Now, as somebody who is very interested in finding life in the universe I can tell you that the more the planets look for the Earth, most enjoy our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invites a comparison between the last discovered and the planets that we know <unk> our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor, Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and despite being a little bit further from the Sun, it can be a potentially livable world demonstrated this by a mission like <unk>
In fact, it's possible that Mars has been habitable in the past, and in part, that's why we study both Mars.
Our <unk> like the <unk> are tracking their surface to find clues about the origins of life as we know it.
The satellites that <unk> as the <unk> mission take samples from the atmosphere and try to understand how Mars has been able to lose its <unk>
Business companies are now offering not only short space flights but also the <unk> chance of living on Mars.
But even though all of these images -- <unk> remind us to the deserts of our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with the ideas and <unk> and <unk> compared to the Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.
Let's take the extension of the <unk> areas of our planet that are still in <unk> places that are really compared to Mars.
Even in the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> of the Earth is cool and filled with oxygen in our forests to thousands of miles away.
I'm worried that this excitement for the colonization of Mars and other planets would end up with a great and sad story, the implication, and the belief of some that Mars would expect there to save this <unk> <unk> of the only planet that we know that is truly livable the Earth.
And so I like the exploration exploration, I'm really deep against this idea.
There's a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but to say that Mars will be there to bring humanity to humanity is as a imagine that the captain of the Titanic will argue that the party actually will be later on the <unk>   Thank you.
But the goals for exploration exploration, and the preservation of the Earth is not <unk>
No, they are actually faces of the same <unk> the goal of understanding, preserve and improve life in the future.
The extreme environments in our world looks like <unk> aliens.
They are just closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and keep <unk> spaces in the hostile and <unk> zones of land, maybe we can satisfy the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
I'll leave you with an experiment with the paradox of <unk>
A lot of years ago, the physicist Enrico Fermi said, "If you realize that our universe has existed for a long time, and we hope that there were many planets in this universe, we should have found evidence of the existence of alien life so far.
Well, where are they?
Well, one possible solution to the paradox paradox is that when civilizations become advanced advanced advanced to consider still living among the stars, they lose the notion of how important it is to protect the origin of the planets that are developing this development.
It's arrogant to think that only colonization, <unk> will save us from ourselves, but the planetary preservation and exploration exploration, can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to engage the hostile environments of Mars to the human presence, then we should be able to overcome the task even easier to preserve <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I would get my own home.
And while I was on the front porch looking at my pockets, I realized I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window in the dining table, where there were <unk>
So quickly tried to open up all the other doors and windows, and all were great.
I thought about calling a <unk> at least in my cell phone, but at midnight, a <unk> might take a long time to get to it, and it was cold.
I couldn't go home from my friend of Jeff to pass the night because he had an early flight to Europe to the next morning, and I took my passport and my bag.
<unk> expensive, but sure it's not more expensive than a <unk> at the middle of the night, so I thought, even though I thought, even though I was in the circumstances, I was living right away.
I'm a <unk> <unk> and a little bit about how the brain works under stress.
<unk> <unk> that goes up the heart rate -- let's give them the levels of adrenaline and <unk> the thought.
And when I got to the counter counter at the airport, I realized I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a lot of time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I began to ask myself, if there was something I could do, systems that I could put in their place, which was going to make bad things.
Or at least, if bad things happen, that will be a total of a total of a total of it.
So I started thinking about that, but until a month later, my thoughts didn't look for.
I was having dinner with my colleague Danny <unk> winner of the Nobel Prize, and a little embarrassed told him about I broke the window, and I had forgotten my passport, and Danny shared with me that I had been practicing something called retrospective <unk>
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written a few years before, known as the <unk>
You all know what's <unk>
Every time there's a disaster, a team of experts come and try to figure out what went wrong, right?
In <unk> as he explains <unk> you look forward and try to figure out all the things that could go wrong, then you try to figure out what can do to prevent things to prevent things out or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk to you about is a few things that we can do in the form of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> others are not so evident.
I'm going to start with the obvious.
In the house, it will be a place for the things that are very easily.
This sounds like common sense, and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this <unk> based on how our space memory.
There's a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to make a track of the location of important things, where the good things are -- where the fish are, that the <unk> trees live, where the tribes are <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that <unk> in the London <unk>
It's the part of the brain that allows the <unk> to find their nuts.
And if you ask if somebody really did the experiment, they <unk> the <unk> sense of <unk> and they still could find their nuts.
They didn't use our smell, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism of the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move much, not so good for things that move a lot.
This is the reason to lose keys from the car, reading reading and <unk>
So in the house, it was a place for the keys, a hook next to the door, maybe a plate <unk>
For your passport, a particular book?
For your reading, a particular <unk>
If you look at a place and they are <unk> with that, your stuff will always be there when the <unk>
What about the <unk>
Take a piece of cell cards a picture of your credit card, leave driving, passport, I hate myself to be in the cloud.
If these things are lost or <unk> this can facilitate <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when you're under stress, your brain releases cortisol.
<unk> is toxic and <unk> the thought.
So part of <unk> practice is to recognize that under stress we will not be at the best time, and you have to put the systems on their site.
And there are perhaps not more stressful situation than when you face a medical decision.
And at some point, we will all be in that situation, of having to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or a loved one to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And to talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this is <unk> as a <unk> for all of them making medical decisions and actually made it for decision-making and social decisions and any kind of decision that we have to take that would benefit from a rational assessment of the facts.
So suppose you go to the physician and the doctor says, "I've gotten the result of the lab and cholesterol is a little bit <unk>
You all know that high cholesterol is associated with a greater risk of heart disease, heart attack, brain injury.
So you're thinking that having high cholesterol is not the best, then the doctor says, "I'd like to <unk> a drug that helps you reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And you probably have heard of the <unk> and it knows that it's one of the most <unk> medications in the world today, even you probably know people who are <unk>
So you think, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
But there's a question that you should ask then, a statistic that you should ask for that most doctors don't want to talk about, and companies drug companies even less.
It's for <unk> the number needed to treat.
And what is this, the <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or submit to a surgery in any medical procedure before you help one person.
And you must think about what kind of statistical statistic is <unk>
The number has to be one.
My doctor didn't give me something if it wasn't to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not <unk> and if it's somebody's guilt -- it's about scientists like me.
We haven't understood very well the mechanisms.
But <unk> estimates that 90 percent of drugs are just about 30 to 50 percent of the people.
So the number required to treat the most widely <unk> what do you think it is?
How many people have it to take it before you help one person?
300.
This was the research of the cynical researchers <unk> and Pamela <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I would explore the numbers.
So 300 people have to take the drug for a year before you avoid a single heart attack, stroke brain or another event.
Now maybe you think, "Well, one probability in 300 to slow down my <unk>
Why not, <unk> <unk> the recipe for all <unk>
But then you have to ask for one more statistical statistic and it is, <unk> of the effects <unk> Yeah?
For this particular drug, the side effects produced in five percent of patients.
And those include things like <unk> <unk> muscle pain and <unk> pain, but now they think, "The Five percent is not very likely to happen to me, still take <unk>
But a moment.
Remember that under stress you don't think clearly.
So think of how to do this over time, so you don't have to make the string of reasoning on the act.
300 people take the drug, right? A person has taken five percent of the 300 people -- they have side effects, that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to get <unk> by the drug that will help you to help you.
I don't say you should or don't take the <unk>
I'm just saying you have to have this conversation with your doctor.
The health ethic is what's required, is part of the informed consent principle.
We have a right to have access to these kinds of information to start the conversation about whether you want to take the risks or not.
And you may be thinking that I've launched this number in the air by the value of the crash, but actually this number necessary to treat is quite typical.
For the surgery that you do in the older men in the older men -- <unk> of prostate cancer, the number necessary to try and <unk>
So 49 surgery for a person who has <unk>
And the side effects in that case are produced in 50 percent of patients.
Those include <unk> or dysfunction -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you're lucky, and it's one of that 50 percent effects only about a year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think of time before the questions that you may have to make our conversation forward.
You don't have to make all this on the act.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because you have a choice, many times, you want a shorter life free of pain, or a longer life that could have a lot longer than the end?
These are the things that they talk about and think about now, with their family and their loved ones.
You can change opinion in the heat of the moment, but at least you're trained in this kind of thought.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at that moment is that you turn a lot of systems.
There's a evolutionary reason for this.
Face with a <unk> you don't need the <unk> system, or the <unk> or the immune system, because if the body is spending the metabolism on those things, it doesn't react very quickly. They could get to be the lunch of the lions, so none of that matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that go through the window during those moments of stress that is rational thinking, <unk> like Danny <unk> and his colleagues have been shown.
So we have to challenge them to think about the future of this kind of situations.
I think the important thing here is to recognize that we're all <unk>
We're all going to fail every time.
The idea is to think about the future how they could be those <unk> to put systems in the place that will help to minimize damage, or to prevent the bad things in the first place.
I went to <unk> on <unk> when I returned from my journey, my contractor set up a <unk> of combination with the door, with a key to the gate of the gate in the end, an easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of letters that I haven't ordered and lots of messages that I haven't seen.
So I'm not very organized, but I see the organization as a <unk> process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> is my favorite music.
It means playing <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument, and you see a <unk> in the score, you need to touch more <unk>
Two <unk> even more smooth.
Four <unk> extremely smooth.
This is my drawing from a tree of <unk> there you see that no matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> may never be able to make a complete silence.
That's my current definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the history of the American system, the <unk> in addition to a little bit of my own story.
The French signs came over the decade in 1800, and over the time, he mixed together with local signs, and developed the language that we now know as <unk>
So, it has a story about 200 years.
I was born <unk> And they taught me to believe that sound was not a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
But now I realize that it's not true for nothing.
The sounds are a very important part of my life, really in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person who lives in a sound world, it's like I lived in a foreign country -- following blindly testing their rules, <unk> behaviors and <unk> <unk>
So how do I understand sound <unk>
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my speakers and <unk> sound.
<unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sound, and I've seen how people <unk>
So I have learned, for example ...
<unk> <unk>
Don't do a lot of noise by eating the bag of potato <unk>
Not <unk> and when you're eating, make sure that the <unk> in the <unk>
All of this is called <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think about the sound label more than the average person does it.
I'm <unk> of the sounds.
And I'm always waiting for <unk> the sound, which is coming next.
From there, this drawing.
<unk> by decide.
<unk> to keep going.
<unk> by <unk>
You can see the <unk> don't have notes in the lines.
That's because the lines already contain sounds through the subtle and subtle <unk>
In <unk> culture, the movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the signal for <unk> in the <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
However, for me to make the eye with my thumb that doesn't feel natural.
That's why I have four lines on paper.
In 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an artistic house there.
Before this time, I had worked as a <unk>
During this summer, I visited museums and spaces of different <unk> and as I went from one place to another, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At that time, the sound was the trend and that called me the <unk>
There was no visual art, everything was <unk>
Now the sound has gone into my territory of art.
It goes to <unk> more of the art?
I realized that it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that it doesn't only happen through the ears.
I can feel it <unk> or experience it visually, or even as an idea.
So I decided to reclaim the sound property and <unk> in my art practice.
And all I had taught me in terms of sound, I decided to leave it and get it.
I started to create a new body of work.
And when I presented it to the art community, I was struck by the amount of support and attention that I got.
I realized that sound is like the money, the power, the social currency.
In the bottom of my mind, I always felt that the sound was <unk> it was a <unk> person.
And the sound is so powerful that it could be <unk> to me and my artistic job, or I could tell me.
I chose that I <unk>
There's a massive culture around language speech.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is as if I didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support me as well and become my voice.
So I am able to be relevant to the current society.
So in school, in the work and institutions, I work with many different performers of <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and an identity.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, by asking <unk> his voices, I'm able to maintain a temporary form of value as well as taking a loan on a very high interest rate.
If I'm not going to continue this practice, I feel that I could focus on <unk> and not have any kind of social value.
So with sound like my new artistic medium, <unk> in the world of music.
And I was surprised to see the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note you can't capture and express fully on the paper.
And the same is true of a concept in <unk>
The two are very <unk> and highly <unk> which means that subtle changes can affect the whole meaning of signals like the sounds.
I would like to share with you a metaphor for the piano, so you get better at how it works.
So, imagine a piano.
The <unk> is divided into many different parameters.
If you <unk> a different <unk> for every finger while the piano is playing the piano, the facial expression, the movement of the body, the speed, the shape of your hand, as you play piano, English is a linear language, as if you look at one key at once.
However, the <unk> is more like a chord -- you need the 10 fingers in a place to express a clear concept or idea in <unk>
If just a key would change in it, it would create a completely different meaning.
The same thing happens with music as much and <unk> and volume.
In <unk> by using these different parameters <unk> you can express different ideas.
So for example, the signature signal in that."
This is the signature signal in that."
I'm looking at.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, <unk>
<unk> oh.
What are you <unk>
Ah, <unk>
So I started thinking, and if I look at <unk> through the glasses of music?
If I had to create a sign and you turn it back and again, it could be like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the <unk> sign comes out and you put it into it.
This is <unk>
If you turn it up, and it <unk> the speed, visually seen as a piece of music.
All day.
I feel that the same is true of <unk> the <unk>
All the <unk>
This is all night, in this drawing.
And this led me to think about three different types of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk>
I feel that the third has more <unk> than the other two.
This represents how time expressed in <unk> and how the distance to the body can express changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is a hand, two <unk> is two hands, and the present is closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body, and the past is on the back.
So the first example is <unk> a lot of time."
Then <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last thing that is my favorite, with a very romantic idea, and dramatic and dramatic and dramatic idea.
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a specific rate of <unk>
Yet when I look at the word <unk> <unk> I think automatically in <unk>
See <unk> <unk> right, <unk> left hand.
We have the <unk> through the head and the chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Can you do with me?
All of the hands on high.
Now we're going to do that in my head as well as the chest, something like <unk> <unk> or <unk>
Yes, very well.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system, as a note, is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and the languages of signs around the world.
The second one that I'd like to show you is this. Please do it again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in the <unk>
Now, third. Please go back again.
And again.
It's <unk> in the <unk>
We're going to do three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good job.
So look at how three signs are very similar. They all occur on the head and the chest but they transmit very different.
It's amazing to see how the <unk> is alive and wealthy as the music.
Yet today, we live in a very <unk> world.
And just because the <unk> doesn't have sound, automatically doesn't have social value.
We have to start questioning what defines social value and allow the <unk> to develop its own value, without sounds.
And this could be a step in order to make a more <unk> society.
And maybe people understand that you don't have to be deaf, to learn <unk> not that you have to hear to learn music.
The <unk> is a disadvantage <unk> and I'd like you to have the same experience.
I'd like to invite you to open up your ears, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience of our visual language.
And you never know, you can even fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents said, "You can take it all, but then you have to <unk>
Freedom means accountability.
But my imagination was led to all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a bubble of innocence or a bubble of ignorance I must say, because adults lied us to protect ourselves from the horrible truth.
And I was older, I found out that adults also <unk> and that they're not very good at getting rid of each other.
Time spent now an adult and teach citizenship and invention in the Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait much for my students to walk through the beach with a lot of trash trash.
So as good citizens, cleaned up the <unk> and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if it is, I don't get it.
It's sad to say, but more than 80 percent of the oceans contain plastic.
It's kind of creepy.
And in the last decades, we've been coming out with these large ships and networks, to collect those plastic chunks to study them under the microscope, and the <unk> and <unk> this information on a map.
But it lasts for an eternity and it's very expensive and it's also too risky to use those enormous <unk>
So along with my students, with ages six to 15 years, we dream to invent a better way.
We have transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We started building this <unk> <unk> work so that the kids very <unk> can also participate.
And I'll tell you the kids that manipulate electrical tools feel great and safe.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We collect plastic and we reduce it to the size that we find it in the ocean, which is very small, because of its <unk>
That we do.
I let the imagination of my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas in every child and try to figure it into something that we hope to work.
We decided instead of collecting plastic chunks just <unk> information.
By using a robot, we take an image of this <unk> the kids were getting a lot of robots.
Then we started to quickly create what we call "a <unk>
We're so fast in creating prototypes that we ended up before lunch.
And we made light bulbs and camera cameras on accessories. And they put it into a floating robot that will move slowly through the water and the plastic that we have there, and this is the image captured by the robot.
We can see the plastic chunks floating slowly through the sensor while the computer on board process this image and measure the size of each <unk> to get an estimate of the amount of plastic in the water.
<unk> this invention step at a website for inventors called <unk> with the hope that someone would get it even more.
The great thing about this project is that the students saw a local problem, and they are trying to fix them immediately.
I'm able to investigate my problem, but my students in Hong Kong are very well kids.
Do you see the news, <unk> the Internet, and it was <unk> with this picture.
A child, maybe less than 10 years ago, cleaning up an oil spill, just using the hands of the hands, in <unk> the world's largest <unk> forest in Bangladesh.
They were very surprised because this is the water that <unk> is the water in which the water is <unk> the water where they live.
You can also see that water is brown, mud and oil are also brown and when everything <unk> it's very hard to see what in the water.
But there is a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to look at what's in the water.
We built a first prototype of a <unk> that can <unk> through all sorts of substances that produce different <unk> what it can help identify what there is in the water.
We put this prototype with a sensor and we send it to Bangladesh.
The great thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or to analyze a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help in a remote way to help in other children.
I'm able to investigate a problem with <unk> I was forced to do a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little further away, maybe to address a harder problem, and also closer to me.
I'm half Japanese and French and probably remember, that in 2011, there was an devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that started several giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> <unk> many cities on the coast of Japan.
Over 14,000 people died in a second.
It also gives the nuclear power plant from Fukushima, a central nuclear power close to water.
And today, according to reports of the average of 300 tons are still leaking from the nuclear plant in the Pacific.
Today, the whole Pacific has traces of pollution by <unk>
If we go to the West coast, we can measure the radiation of <unk> everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it seems that most of the radiation disappeared from the Japanese coast -- and most of the time, it has a secure thing, it's blue.
Well, the reality is a little bit more complicated than that.
I've gone back to <unk> every year from the accident and research, independently with other scientists, the land, the river, and this time we wanted to take the kids.
Of course not the <unk> the parents don't <unk>
But every night you go to the center of the <unk> you see the use of different masks here.
It might seem that they didn't take work seriously, but they did it because they're going to have to live with the <unk> their whole life.
Together with them we discussed the <unk> data, that day and we talk about what we were going to do afterwards, the strategies, the <unk> and so on.
And to do this, we created a <unk> map of the region around the nuclear power plant.
We created the map of <unk> <unk> pigments to represent data in real time of <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
With this we were able to notice that the radioactive powder is <unk> from the top of the mountain to the <unk> system and <unk> in the ocean.
It was a <unk> estimate.
But based on this we organized an civil expedition, the closest to the nuclear power to date.
We are approaching up to 1.5 miles of nuclear station, and with the price of fishermen <unk> we were collecting <unk> <unk> with a <unk> <unk> with a <unk> <unk> that we invented and built it.
Here we see a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem to a global problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales, also with open-source technologies and very simple technologies.
But at the same time, it has been increasingly frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage we've done.
We haven't even begun to try to solve the problems.
I wonder if we should give the leap and try to invent better ways to do all of these things.
So the classroom became a little bit so small so we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong and we become the biggest space dedicated to the social and environmental impact.
It's in the middle of Hong Kong and it's a place where we can work with wood, metal chemistry, a little bit of biology, of optical fibers, you can basically build almost everything there.
It's also a place where adults and kids can play together.
It's a place where the dreams of children can actually become the help of adults, and where adults can be kids again.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> We asked things like, we can invent the future of mobility with <unk>
So for example.
Or can we help in the movement of the current age transforming their standard wheels chairs into new self-driving cars.
The plastic, oil and <unk> are <unk> terrible, but the worst legacy we can leave our kids are lies.
We cannot afford to protect the children of the awful truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So, American citizens creators, we have to prepare the next generation to get care of the environment and people, and so that I can actually do something about it.
Thank you.
Two <unk> <unk> two cultures of radically opposite design.
One is made out of thousands of pieces of steel, the other of a little silk loop.
One of them is synthetic the other organic one.
One is imposes on the environment, the other thing I believed it.
One is designed by nature, the other for it.
Michelangelo once said that when he looked at the <unk> <unk> he saw a figure that fight for being free.
The <unk> was only a tool of Michelangelo.
But living things are not <unk>
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, the cells, we took all of the information that was required by every cell to work and to make it out.
The tools also have consequences.
At least since the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by manufacturing and mass production.
The assembly lines have dictated a world made out of parts, <unk> the imagination of designers and architects trained to think of their objects like <unk> of different parts with different functions.
But you don't find <unk> material in nature.
Think of the human skin, for example.
Our facial skins are thin with microscopic pores of it.
The skins of the back is more thick with little <unk>
You act primarily like filter the other mostly like barrier, and yet it's the same <unk> there's no parts, there's no <unk>
It's a system that vary gradually its functionality through the variation of <unk>
Here's a divided screen that represents my vision of the world -- the double personality of every designer and architect working on the <unk> and the gene, between the machine, and the organism, between the assembly and the growth, between the assembly and the growth, and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and the law, analysis and synthesis, is shown in the two screens behind me.
My work, at its simplest level, tries to bring these two visions of the world, stepping away from the assembly and coming up to growth.
You probably ask yourselves why now?
Why wasn't it possible about 10 or even five years ago.
We live in a very special moment in history, a weird moment, where they have four disciplines that offers access to tools that we never had access to before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I thought.
Please know the minds and my students' hands.
We are designing objects, products, structures and tools through large-scale scales, as this robotic arm with an scope of 24 meters in diameter with a <unk> basis that one day not very distant and graphics buildings that glow in the darkness.
Here we have <unk> the <unk> an archetype of the ancient Arab architecture, and it has created a screen where each opening opens is <unk> to model the form of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explore the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> -- this was for a fashion dynamics in Paris with <unk> <unk> It's like a second skin made out of one piece, <unk> in the flexible <unk> around the waist.
Together with <unk> 3D printing <unk> we print this layer and 3D <unk> <unk> and <unk> and I'll show you more objects like that.
This helmet combines <unk> materials and <unk> in the resolution of 20 <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a <unk> scanner.
That designers have access to this high-resolution analytical and the <unk> instruments that allow us to design products that are <unk> not just the way our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We also designed a acoustic chair, a chair -- comfortable and also absorbs sound.
Professor <unk> my collaborator came back to nature to <unk> and to design this <unk> pattern becomes <unk>
It <unk> this surface of 44 different properties, which vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> the pressure points in the human body.
Their surface, like in nature, vary its functionality not by addition to the addition of other material or another <unk> but continuously and <unk> the material property.
But it's <unk> nature.
There are no parts in nature?
I wasn't raised in a religious Jew but when I was young, my grandmother told me stories of the Bible <unk> and one of them came to me and came to define a lot of what matters to me.
As she said, "In the third day of <unk> God sends the Earth to grow a <unk> tree <unk> <unk>
For that first <unk> tree, there would be no difference between trunk, branches, leaves and <unk>
The whole tree was a piece of fruit.
Instead, the land made the land grow trees with branches, cortex, <unk> and flowers.
The land created a world made of parts.
I often ask myself, "What would design would be if the objects were made from a single part?
Tell a better state of <unk>
So we look for the material -- the kind of material of the <unk> tree with fruits, and we found it.
The second largest <unk> on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons produced by organisms like shrimp, crabs, <unk> and <unk>
We thought that if we could tune their property, we could generate structures that are embedded in one piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it <unk>
<unk> chemical ships, we've been able to make a wide range of property, from dark, hard and <unk> to light, soft and transparent.
To print the large-scale structures that was built a system with multiple <unk> of <unk> <unk>
The robot could change the properties of the material on the march and create these structures made from a single three material -- 100 percent recyclable
When the pieces are ready, you dry it up to find a natural way to contact with the air.
So why do we keep designing with <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process used to contain microorganisms, <unk> that first appeared on the planet about 3.5 billion years ago, as we heard yesterday.
Together with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, <unk> the bacteria designed to capture rapidly carbon in the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we have been able to generate structures that make their transition without the <unk> <unk> and if it broadens even more longer, to window.
A <unk> tree <unk> <unk>
Working with an old material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water and with a little bit of synthetic biology, we've transformed a structure of husks of shrimp in an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here's the best <unk> for objects designed to <unk> jobs in the sea, which is <unk> life and placed on the ground, will help grow a tree.
<unk> for our next exploration using the same design principles was the solar system.
We are looking for the possibility of creating clothes to keep the life for <unk>
To do that, we need to master the bacteria and control its flow.
So like the <unk> <unk> we did our own table of <unk> new forms of life created <unk> made in <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I like to think of synthetic biology as the liquid <unk> only that instead of <unk> metals -- new biological functionalities into very small channels.
This field is called <unk>
<unk> our own 3D channels to control the flow of these <unk> crops.
In our first piece of clothes, they were <unk> two microorganisms.
The first is <unk>
It lives in our oceans and the ponds of fresh water.
And the second E. <unk> the bacteria that <unk> into the human intestine.
It turns out to be the light in sugar, the other <unk> sugar and produces useful biofuels for the built environment.
But these two microorganisms, don't interact in nature.
In fact, they never <unk>
They're here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship in a piece of clothes.
Think of it as evolution, not natural selection, but evolution by design.
In order to contain these relationships, we've created a single channel that looks like the <unk> tract that will help you to make these bacteria and that we can make their function of the way.
So we started making those channels in the human body, <unk> the properties of material as the functionality of <unk> function.
If we wanted more <unk> we had more transparent channels.
This digestive system, when it stretches from one end to another, it's 60 feet.
This is half the length of a football field, and 10 times more than our gut intestine.
And here it is, like <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> channels with life inside the clothes.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are <unk> creatures -- only half is <unk>
What if design would provide the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that increase <unk>
And if we could create personal <unk> that we <unk> our skin -- <unk> the tissue being destroyed and <unk> our <unk>
Think of this as a way of editing biology.
I call this the material ecology.
To do that, you always have to come back to nature.
And so you know that a 3D printer prints material in layers.
You also know that nature doesn't do that.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
This cocoon of <unk> for example, creates a highly sophisticated highly sophisticated architecture, a home within which they were <unk>
The manufacturing is not about this level of <unk>
It does it through the combination of two materials, but two proteins in different <unk>
One acts as a structure, the other is the glue or the matrix, we put those fibers in.
And this happens across scales.
The silk worm first went into the environment, create a tension structure, and then it starts <unk> a cocoon of compression.
The tension and the <unk> the two forces of life, are manifest in a single material.
In order to understand how this complex process works, we attach a small magnet to the head of a silk worm to the <unk>
We put it inside a box with fluorescent sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualizing the complex architecture of the cocoon of silk.
However, when I put the silk worm into a flat patch -- not within a box, we realized that it <unk> a flat, flat cocoon still <unk>
So we started designing different across different settings -- and we've discovered that the shape, the composition, the <unk> structure was transmitted directly by the environment.
It often was <unk> the silk worms to death within their <unk> and their silk is <unk> and it is used in the <unk> industry.
We saw that designing these templates we could shape the raw silk without boiling a single <unk>
It was <unk> <unk> and we could create these things.
So we climbed this process up to the architectural scale.
We had a <unk> robot, making silk, and we put into our site.
We knew that <unk> silk worms are <unk> and <unk> so we use a solar road diagram to reveal the distribution of light and heat into our structure.
So we created holes or <unk> to block the rays from light and heat down, are the silk worms over the structure.
We were ready to get <unk>
<unk> <unk> silk worms on the line.
And after <unk> four weeks, they were ready to be prepared with us.
We put them carefully on the bottom edge of the <unk> and as he <unk> <unk> they were <unk> they got <unk> and the life starts again, like us, but much, much longer.
Buckminster Fuller said that tension is the great integrity, and he was right.
As biological silk on <unk> <unk> <unk> all this pavilion on our integrity.
And in a little more than two or three weeks, you know, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
In a curious symmetry, this is also the length of the silk route.
The <unk> after the <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 additional <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A <unk> silk through a robotic arm, the other full <unk>
If the last frontier of design is to give products to the products and the buildings around us, to form an ecology of two materials, the designers have to bring these two visions in the world.
Which brings us back, of course, at the beginning.
Here's a new era of design, a new era of creation, which brings us from a design inspired in nature to a nature inspired by the design that requires us, for the first time, that we take care of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Hands up if you've ever wondered what you want to be <unk>
If you had to remember what age they had when they asked them for the first time.
You can stick with your fingers.
Three. Five. Five. Five.
Now, raise your hand if you ask the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
It has caused some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm somebody who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
The problem wasn't that I had no interest, but I had <unk>
In the school, I liked the English, the <unk> and art and started singing websites, but he was playing the guitar in a punk band called <unk> <unk>
Maybe you've heard about us.
And I generally like to test and persist in every case, for having spent a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But over time, this sense of <unk> this sense of, this is no longer a challenge, it comes to <unk>
And I have to let it go.
But then I was amazed by something else, something completely different, and I was going to sit on it, and I let me absorb and feel <unk> I've found you <unk> and then again this point where I start to <unk>
And finally, I want to let it go.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to get a way to go into that.
This was a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first one was because I wasn't sure about how it was going to turn all this into a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing, to deny all of my own passions, and <unk> to <unk>
Another reason I was so much anxiety was a little bit more personal.
I was worried that there was something wrong with this, and something wrong with me for nothing.
I was worried to be afraid of engagement, or to be dispersed, or to <unk> or my own success.
If you can relate my story and these feelings, I'd like to ask you something I'd like to have ever gotten back then.
It <unk> themselves, where they learned to allocate the meaning of bad or abnormal to do things.
I'm going to tell you where they did it, they learned about culture.
So what do you want to ask yourself, "What do you want to be <unk>
When we have about five years.
And the truth is that nobody cares about what we were at that age.
It's considered a naive question to make nice answers in children like, <unk> <unk> or <unk> or "I want to be <unk>
<unk> the <unk> <unk> here.
So this question is going over and over again, as we grow in various ways, we will have a question of high school students who are asked to pick up at university.
And at some point, "What do you want to be <unk>
It's about being the cute exercise before we take away the dream.
Why?
While this issue is inspired by children to dream with what they might be, is not inspired by dreaming of what they might be.
In fact, it does just the opposite, because when someone asks you what you want to be, you can't respond to 20 different things, even though adults good at the same time, you might be <unk> and say, "Oh, how do you cute, but you can't be <unk> and <unk>
You have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>  And he is <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And this Amy <unk> editor made in <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
All you hear is they're going to have to choose to.
But it's more than that.
The whole notion of life is <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of fate or the real <unk> the idea that each of us has something to do with your time on this land, and you have to figure out what that thing is and to devote your life to it.
But if you're somebody who is not connected in this way?
What if there are many different issues that wake up their curiosity and lots of different things that want to do?
There's no place for someone like one in that framework.
And so you can feel it alone.
You can feel it doesn't have a goal.
And feeling there's something wrong with one.
There's nothing wrong in you.
You're a <unk>
A <unk> is somebody with a lot of interest and creative activities.
It's a breath that's so <unk>
Could it help you divide in three parts: some potential and <unk>
You can also use other terms of terms of the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
During the age of the Renaissance, the ideal was who was <unk> in multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> refers to us as <unk>
It takes any word that you like or <unk> your own.
It seems like a kind of adapt to a community, we can't agree with a single identity.
It's easy to see <unk> like limitation or <unk> that you should win.
But what I've learned about talking to people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are huge strengths in being this way.
Here are three superpowers are <unk>
One: the synthesis of ideas.
I mean, the combination of two or more fields and creating something new in the <unk>
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> their shared interest in cartography, visualization data and mathematics and design, when I found <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates jewelry <unk>
In <unk> and Rachel came up with this unique idea by his <unk> mixture of skills and experiences.
Innovation is happening at intersections.
That's where new ideas come from.
And the <unk> with all your background, you can access a lot of these points of <unk>
The second superpower <unk> is good learning.
When we were <unk> we are <unk> we're going to do it.
We look at everything we can have in our hands.
We're used to being <unk> because of having been a lot of times in the past, and this means that we have less fear of testing new things and coming out of our comfort.
A lot of skills are <unk> other disciplines, and we bring everything that we have learned to each new zone that <unk> so we rarely start from zero.
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> full-time and <unk>
As a pianist who had an amazing ability to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the most fast <unk>
Before it turned to the writer, it was <unk> financial <unk>
He had to learn the most fine sales mechanics when he was starting his bones, and this ability helps to write compelling <unk> for the editors.
It's rarely a waste of time to do what you would get to you, even if you end it up.
It's possible to apply that knowledge in a completely different field, in a way that you couldn't have <unk>
The third superpower <unk> is adaptability. I mean, the ability to transform anything you need in a <unk> situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes director of videos, other Internet designer designer pages, sometimes consultant to Kickstarter, sometimes a teacher, sometimes James <unk>
It's valuable because it does a good job.
He is even more valuable because it can take a lot of different <unk> depending on the needs of their clients.
Science Magazine defines adaptability as the most important ability for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so rapidly and <unk> that are the individuals and organizations that are able to deal with them to meet the market needs that really <unk>
<unk> of ideas, quickly learning and <unk> three skills where <unk> are very <unk> and three skills that could be lost if they're <unk> to reduce their goals.
As a society, we have a great interest in encourage the <unk> to be themselves.
We have complex problems, <unk> right now, and we need creative thinkers to deal with them.
Let's say they are, in your heart.
<unk> from the belly knowing because they wanted to be <unk> <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you either.
In fact, some of the best teams get up with a specialist and a <unk> <unk>
The specialist can dive in depth and put ideas, and <unk> offers a amplitude of knowledge to a project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all have to design lives and careers that we're going to do with how we're connected.
And unfortunately, to the <unk> in large part of them are told that they're just more like your fellow <unk>
Once I said this, if there's one thing that you take from this talk, I hope it's this: <unk> with the inner wiring -- whatever it is.
If you're a heart of heart, then you go through all the media.
That's where you give the best of it.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those who just realized being one of them in the last 12 minutes,   I say, <unk> with their own many passions.
Follow his curiosity for those <unk> <unk>
<unk> the intersections.
<unk> our inner wiring leads to a more authentic life and happy.
And perhaps most importantly, <unk> the world will be <unk>
Thank you.
In the year we went to a woman named <unk> they took a psychiatric institution.
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember even the most basic details of his life.
His doctor was called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but <unk> for her until he was unfortunately passed away in <unk>
After her death, <unk> did a <unk> and they found weird plates and <unk> in the brain of <unk> in a guy that had never seen before.
But the most amazing thing is there.
If we had been alive today, we could not give it to her more help than that <unk> gave him a few years ago.
<unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer's.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient to get a diagnosis that we now call Alzheimer's disease.
From <unk> medicine has advanced <unk>
They have gotten antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from <unk> many treatments for cancer cancer, antiretroviral people, <unk> for <unk> and much more.
But a little bit has been progress in Alzheimer's disease.
I am part of a team of scientists working to find a cure for Alzheimer's disease for more than a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's now affects 40 million all over the world.
But by 2050, it will affect 150 million that, by the way, to include many of you.
If you expect to live up to 85 years or more, the possibility of Alzheimer's will be almost one of two.
In other words, there is the likelihood that you have to spend your years with Alzheimer's or helping care of a friend or be dear with Alzheimer's.
Just in America, Alzheimer's disease costs 200 billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars of health care is on Alzheimer's disease.
Today it's the most expensive disease and its costs -- <unk> increase in five times by 2050, as we get the generation of <unk> boom.
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the biggest doctors and social challenges of our generation.
But it's been relatively <unk> to <unk>
Today, one of the top 10 causes of death of the whole world, Alzheimer's is the only one that cannot be <unk> cure or even slow into their development.
We understand less than Alzheimer's disease than we have spent less time and money in the research of itself.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more every year in cancer cancer than in Alzheimer's cancer despite the fact that we have more Alzheimer's and causes a year number like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a more fundamental cause, lack of consciousness.
Because this is what time people know, but the whole world <unk> Alzheimer's is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last <unk> years, all of the scientists, <unk> Alzheimer's with aging.
We think it's going to be <unk> in an inevitable part of aging.
But you only have to look at a picture of a healthy brain in comparison with one of a Alzheimer's patient to see the real physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to making a severe memory of memory and mental skills, the damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer's percent significantly life expectancy and is always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found plates and <unk> strangers in the brain of <unk> a century.
For almost a century, we didn't know a lot about this.
We now know that they're made of protein molecules today.
You can think of a protein molecule like a piece of paper that folds up like a origami.
There are places in the paper that are <unk>
And when it folds out, these <unk> dots end up inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some <unk> points are left in the outside.
This makes the protein molecules <unk> each other, forming groups that can form big plates and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There are many steps, and the identification on which step is complex, like <unk> a bomb.
<unk> a cable could do anything.
It <unk> others can make the bomb bomb.
You have to find out the right step that we can do it, and then create a drug that it does.
Until recently, most of the wires have been reduced and expected the best.
But now there's a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, and physicists, physicists, physicists, engineers, engineers and mathematicians.
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process. Now it's testing a new kind of drugs that block specifically this way to stop the disease.
I'll show you some of our latest results.
No one out of our lab has seen it yet.
Let's see a few videos of what happened when we test these drugs in <unk>
These are the healthy worms and you can see that they move normally.
These worms on the other hand, have a protein molecules that stick in each other into them, as humans with Alzheimer's.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But by giving our new drugs these worms at a early stage, then we see that <unk> and live a normal life.
This is just an initial opening result: but research as this shows that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years of wait, there's real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But so that it grows that hope, of overcoming Alzheimer's disease, we need help.
This is not scientists like me, it's about you.
We need to convince us that Alzheimer's is a disease and if we will, we can <unk>
In the case of other diseases, patients and their families have taken more research and <unk> pressure industry, pharmaceutical industry, and <unk>
That was essential to advance the HIV treatment in the late '80s.
Today we see that same unit and defeat cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't speak for themselves.
And their families, the Mayan victims with their loved ones and night, are often too <unk> to go out and advocate for change.
So it really depends on you.
Alzheimer's is not, in most cases a genetic disease.
Everybody with a brain runs the risk.
Today, there are 40 million patients as <unk> who can't create the change that they need for themselves.
<unk> talking for them, and help to demand a cure.
Thank you.
This article in the New York Times, the New York Times, in January of this year.
To fall in love with somebody, I do this.
The article is about a psychological study designed to create romantic love, in the lab, and my own experience of testing it myself to be one night last summer.
So the procedure is quite simple: two strangers are <unk> to be 36 more personal questions, and then they both look at the eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions of example.
Number three: If you could wake up tomorrow with a quality or skill, what would be?
Number <unk> When was the last time you go to another person?
And they <unk>
<unk> -- these are increasingly personal and more personal.
Number three: <unk> really <unk> <unk> to your partner what you like to do, or she -- I know very honest this time, and I gave things that you wouldn't say to somebody you've ever met.
When I stumbled across this study a few years ago, a really detail struck me about attention, the gadget that two of the participants had married six months later and invited everything from the lab to <unk>
So, it was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but of course, I was also <unk>
And when I had a chance to test this study, with somebody who knew not particularly good, I didn't expect to <unk>
However, we were <unk> and --  And I thought it was a good story, so I send it to the Love <unk>
That was published in January, and now it's already <unk> so I guess some of you are likely to ask, they are likely to ask, they still will.
And the reason I think you're asking for this is because I've done this question over and over the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to it.
A week before this was published the article was very nervous.
I had been working in a romantic book in the last few years, so I had asked me to write about my experience in romantic love on my blog.
But a blog blog can come to a few hundred views like a lot, and those were usually just my Facebook friends and imagined that my article in the New York Times would probably have a thousand views.
And that came up with a very good health burden in a relatively new relationship.
But as he gave it no idea.
The article was printed on a Friday night and once Saturday, this happened on the traffic of my blog.
And Sunday, I had already called the Berkeley, Show and "Good <unk> <unk>
In a month, the article got over eight million views, and I was, for saying something, little prepared for this kind of attention.
And one thing is to foster trust writing that we think about their own experiences -- but another thing is to discover that the loving life of one has been international news -- and that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people call it, what they did every day for weeks, they always, they did first the same question, they still follow together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I made a quick search on my email in my email with the phrase, <unk> <unk>
And several messages appeared immediately.
They were students and journalists and strange <unk> like this.
I was interviewed on radio and <unk>
Even I gave a talk, and a woman yelled at the stage, "Hey <unk> where is your <unk>
And I immediately got red.
I understand that this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in an international study, you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it.
But I wasn't prepared for the wingspan of the answer.
The 36 thousand questions seemed to have <unk>
In fact, the New York Times published an article <unk> for San <unk> which included the experiences of readers by testing the study with different degrees of success.
So my first urge for all this attention was to be very <unk> with my own relationship.
I said not every request that we both make public emergence together.
We had television interviews, and <unk> the orders of photos of us two.
I think I was afraid of becoming the icons <unk> from the process of <unk> a range that I didn't feel at all.
And I understand that people didn't want to know if the study worked -- they wanted to know whether it was really <unk> I mean, if I was able to produce love love -- not just an adventure, but real love, love <unk>
But this was a question that I didn't feel able to answer.
My relationship was just a few months and I felt, mostly that people asked the wrong question.
How do you know if you go together or not, and it also <unk>
If the answer was no, I would make the experience of making these 36 questions less interesting?
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions in this particular study in 1997. And there the research goal wasn't to produce romantic love.
Instead of that, I was looking for interpersonal approach, between college students, using what <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Sounds romantic, right?
But I did it work.
Participants were felt closer to doing that, several later studies, they also used historic protocol protocol -- as a quick way to create trust and interaction between strangers.
They have used it with members of the police and the community, and they've used it between people of the opposite political <unk>
The original version of the story, which I proved last summer, which combines personal questions with four minutes of visual contact, was cited in this article, but unfortunately never published.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk at a little <unk> liberal arts university, and then a student came to me and said to me with <unk> <unk> the study and didn't work.
He seemed <unk> for it.
And I said, "You want to say you <unk> the person with whom you do it.
Well he made a pause.
I think she just wants to be friends.
And I said, but they got better friends?
<unk> that they were able to get better after trying to test the research.
The <unk>
So, <unk> I said.
However, I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you are looking for when it comes to love.
I came across the study for the first time when I was 29, and I was going through a really difficult separation to me.
I had had that relationship since he had 20, which was mostly my adult life, and he was my first true love, and I had no idea how or I could live without it.
So I put in science.
And so I was able to do everything I could find about the science of romantic love, and I expected that that could be a certain form of my heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the moment I thought I just research for the book that I write but in retrospect, it seems really <unk>
I thought that if I was obsessed with the knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel so bad and I used to feel like I was then.
And all of this knowledge has been useful in one way or another.
I'm a more patient with love with love.
I have more confidence to demand what I'm after.
But I can also see me more clearly, and I can realize that what I'm looking for is sometimes more than reasonably can demand me.
What I'm looking for love is a guarantee -- not just to be <unk> today and to be <unk> tomorrow, but that will remain <unk> indefinitely by the person I love.
It may be that this is the guarantee that people were asking when they wanted to know whether we were still together.
The story that the media told about the 36 questions is that there may be a shortcut to <unk>
There may be a way to somehow mitigate some of the risk, and this is a very glamorous story, because fall in love to make us feel beautifully, but it's also terrifying.
But I think when it comes to love, we're very willing to accept the short version of the story.
The story of the story that says, still together?
And their content with a reply or No.
So more than a question, let's ask us to make questions more difficult, questions like, "How do you decide who deserves your love and who doesn't?
How do you stay in love when things are <unk> and how to know when to cut and <unk>
How do you live with the uncertainty that inevitably leads to a relationship? Or even more, how do you live in the question of your <unk>
I don't necessarily know the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good beginning to have a more <unk> conversation about what it means to love someone.
So if you want the short version of the history of my relationship, it's <unk> a year ago, a known one and I apply a study designed to create romantic love, we continue to still together, and I'm very <unk>
But fall in love is not the same thing to remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my <unk> Love didn't happen.
We had fallen in love, because we took the choice to be.
And I <unk> it right now, not because it's not true, but because at the time, I hadn't considered everything that was supposed to be.
I didn't think how many times we would have to make that decision, and how much times will I have to continue to make that choice without knowing before he would always pick up or not.
I want you to be enough to have done and responded to 36 questions, I have chosen to love somebody as generous, kind of generous, and have expressed that choice in the largest day in the United States.
But what I've done, instead is turning my relationship to the kind of myth that I don't think about.
And what we were going to do, and what maybe is my life looking for is that that myth is true.
I want the happy ending to implicit in the title of my article, which is, by the way, the only part of the article that I didn't really wrote.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to choose someone, and the hope that he will also love, and it's frightening, but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by some <unk> <unk> and in a certain way I got a <unk>
The city of New York does a while.  One thing that really affected me but more details to me.
I'll start with when I was eight years old.
And I took a box of wood, and I took a dollar bill a dollar, a pen and a fork in it somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought some strange <unk> or some aliens would find this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our kind of <unk> ideas, for example, how we eat <unk>
I had no idea.
Anyway, it's got fun because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still doing boxes.
At a moment I was in <unk> <unk> like to go out of a tour -- and I <unk> and all those things <unk> and I was doing a collage for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took out all the pages and I took a kind of <unk> <unk> of the Agnes Martin <unk> and a bee was <unk>
Well, my mother is afraid of bees, and it's <unk> to them, so I added more resin on the canvas, thinking that I could <unk>
Instead, it happened, in some way it seemed to grow up size, as if it was that we get the text with a <unk>
So I did <unk> I built more boxes.
This time, I started adding electronic elements, strange bottles that was finding out the street, everything I could find, because I was looking for things all my life, trying to figure out stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that my God, I can draw in space.
I can flow <unk> drawing as you do about a <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I took the objects and I created my own <unk> <unk>
First of all, let's tell you that you can get an idea.
Then I made some insects and strange creatures.
It was very fun to draw in the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started building exhibitions and those things, and I was making some money, to take my girlfriend for dinner, for example, go to <unk>
It was really cool, man.
At some point I became interested in the human form, sculptures of resin natural size with drawings of humans inside layers.
It was great, except for one thing: I was hooked.
I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill.
And I was going to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing in the glass layers which was similar to the drawing in a window, and then in another window and another window, and I had all these windows together that formed a three-dimensional composition on it.
And this really works, and so I could stop using <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work with something very big -- I call <unk>
For the <unk> I was inspired by the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> which is a painting in the Museum of <unk> in Spain.
Can you know?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little bit ahead of your time.
Well, the <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs 11 pounds.
5.5 meters long.
It has double faces, so it's 10 feet of composition.
It's kind of weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left, it's Jesus and the <unk>
There's a cave where all these creatures with animal heads travel between two worlds.
They go from the world of <unk> to this <unk> mesh mesh where he <unk>
This is where the creatures with heads of animals are headed to the <unk> lists for suicide <unk> in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised of thousands of elements.
This is a bird God tied to a <unk>
Billy Graham is in the <unk> The <unk> -- the <unk> platform.
But somehow, also a kind of <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits out oil in a hand while the other hand comes clouds.
Their hands are like <unk> and it looks like a <unk> that keeps the Earth and the cosmos in balance.
So this is a aspect of <unk>
It's a little bit of a narrative.
That's the hand that we <unk>
And then when you go to the other hand, you have a <unk> like a bird's eye <unk> and it spits out its <unk>
It also has a half feet long, a <unk> tail that binds to the <unk>
Anyway, his tail turn fire to the <unk> about a <unk>
I don't know why it happened.
Things that go, you know.
His tail ends up in a <unk> eye of <unk> made from terrorist terrorist cards.
You have <unk>
They were made in the 1980s, as if they were baseball cards of the terrorists.
Very <unk> to his time.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
This is a six-year-old project to make 100 of these human beings.
Each of them is an archive of our culture, through media and material will be tested dictionaries or magazines.
But each one acts as a kind of archive file, and they travel in groups of 20, four or 12 at the time.
These are as cells, they come together, <unk>
And you can walk between them. It's <unk>
Each one is basically a <unk> microscope that weighs 1,300 pounds.
This has a little cave on the chest.
That's the <unk> it's the chest, it can be <unk>
I will see you for the rest of the body -- there's a waterfall that comes out of the chest, and that you cover the penis or <unk> or whatever you have, a kind of thing <unk>
It's a quick refresher of these works because I can't afford it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see.
This is a broken body in half.
This has two heads -- and it's communicating between the two.
There are some pills coming out and come in the head of this strange statue there.
There's a little forest scene inside the <unk> <unk>
Can you imagine?
Anyway, this talk is about these <unk> just like the boxes that we live in.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a brick box. It's called <unk> <unk>
Within this box there is a physicist, a neuroscientist, a painter, a musician, a writer, a radio station a museum, a museum, a <unk> a <unk> a <unk> of the content we do in the world, and a garden.
It took the box and all of the people in this pathway to each other like particles.
And I think that's how we change the world.
When you get <unk> who is and the box that's living in.
And together we got to realize that we're all together in this, that this illusion that we are different, these concepts of countries, of religion, from religion, doesn't work.
We're all very made of the same matter and in the same box.
And if we don't start to swap those things and sweetness and we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do you do when they hurt your head?
They take a <unk>
But so that this pill has effect on pain, first of the stomach, the <unk> and other organs.
You take a pill is the most effective and most effective system for any alternative drug in the body.
The <unk> however, is that the <unk> any drug gets <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in HIV patients.
When they make drugs that are going to be able to decrease the number of viruses in the blood, and increase the count of stem cells.
But they are also known for their side side effects on its negative, because in the time you take the current up, you will be <unk> and even for the time that it takes us to come to its destiny, which is where most importantly, in the <unk> of HIV.
These are regions of the body as the lymph nodes. The nervous system, where the virus is <unk> and it doesn't easily go into the blood stream of patients that will be given to regular therapy with antiretroviral drugs.
But after the disruption of treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new cells.
This is the great problem of HIV treatment with the current drugs that is a lifetime treatment for life running through oral <unk>
One day, I sat down, and I thought, <unk> to get the treatment directly into the warehouse of the virus, without the risk of <unk> from <unk>
As a scientific expert in <unk> the answer was in front of me: <unk> of course.
If you use it in <unk> to care of wounds and surgery, you can be used for anything <unk> including <unk> transport for drugs.
In fact, we're already using laser pulses to open or drill extremely small holes, which open up and closed almost immediately the cells infected with HIV to introduce drugs.
The best people say, "What is that <unk>
We sent a little, powerful beam of laser on the cell membrane with HIV while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser goes through the cell, as the cell absorbs the drug into a matter of microseconds.
Before you even realize it, the hole is <unk> immediately.
We're testing this technology in vitro or <unk> plates, but the goal is to take this technology into the human body, apply it to the human body.
"How is that <unk> you can ask.
Well, the answer is, through a device of three heads.
With the first head, which is our laser, we'll make a <unk> on the site of the infection.
The second head, which is a camera, is heading to the site of the infection.
Finally, the third head, a <unk> that distributes the drug, it releases directly into the site of infection, whereas the laser is used again to keep the cells open.
Well, this doesn't look very much about it.
But one day, if you succeed, this technology can lead to the total eradication of HIV body.
Yeah. One cure for HIV.
This is the dream of every research researcher in our case, a laser treatment.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've studied armed groups, military groups such as terrorists, insurgents or <unk>
<unk> what these groups do when they're not <unk>
My goal is to understand better to these agents of violence generators and study ways of encouraging the transition from violent participation to violent confrontation at <unk>
I do work work in the world of politics and the library.
Understanding these groups is key to solving nearly everything in course, because the war has changed.
It used to be a dispute between states.
Not anymore.
Now it's a conflict between the states and actors.
For example, of <unk> peace deals in 1975 and 2011, <unk> had signed up between a state and an non-governmental actor.
So we need to understand these <unk> we have even <unk> or <unk> in any process of successful conflict resolution.
But how do you do it?
We have to know what motivates these organizations.
We know very well the reasons why they do it, but nobody looks at what they do when they don't <unk>
The armed struggle and the policies are not <unk>
It's all part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global view.
Living groups today are complex organizations.
For example, the <unk> <unk> known for its violent forecast against Israel.
From its creation in the 1980s, <unk> has also established a political party, a network of social services and a military device.
Similarly, the Palestinian <unk> known for their suicide attacks against Israel, also runs <unk> in Gaza since 2007.
So these groups make more than just shooting.
They're multitasking
It will be a complex web of communication stations of radio channels, web channels, web web websites and strategies in social networks.
And here's the printed <unk> magazine in English and published to <unk>
The armed groups are also investing in a complex fundraising <unk> but by using business <unk> for example, building companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their funding, to recruit better and build their brand.
<unk> groups also make something else: they create stronger ties with their population investing in social services.
They build schools, run in their own professional training programs or <unk>
<unk> offers all these services and more.
<unk> groups also try to conquer the population offering something that the state cannot safely and protection.
The rise of the Taliban in a Afghanistan ripped out in the war or even the direct ascent of <unk> can also understand the efforts of these groups for providing safety.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has a price growth for the population.
But in general, to provide social services that means filling up a vacuum, a <unk> gap by the government, and allow these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the election victory of 2006, of Palestinian Hamas cannot be understood without acknowledging the social work of the group.
It's a really complex scenario -- even in the West, when we look at groups -- we just think of the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, strategy or long-term vision.
These groups are <unk>
<unk> because they have these <unk> gaps by government, and they emerge as armed groups and political groups, participate in nonviolent struggle and governance.
And the more complex and the more they are these organizations, we can less <unk> as something contrary to a state.
How would you call a group like <unk>
They were part of a territory, running all of its function, collect the trash, run the <unk> system.
It's a state? It's a <unk> group.
Or maybe it's something else, something new and different.
And what is it <unk>
The lines were <unk>
We live in a world of states of <unk> nations and hybrids and the more weak people are states, like in the Middle East today, more <unk> and fill that gap actors.
This is important for governments, because to counter these groups will have to invest more in military tools.
<unk> that government void has to be at the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and strengthen peace.
If we can better understand <unk> we will understand what incentives to offer to foster the transition from violence to violence.
In this new dispute between states and actors, not <unk> military power can win some battles, but not giving us peace and stability.
In order to achieve these goals we need long-term investments to fill out that safety void to fill that vacuum of government that allowed these groups to thrive in a principle.
Thank you.
I'm a failure as a woman, and as a feminist.
My opinions about gender equality are <unk> but I'm afraid to embrace the label of <unk> it would be unfair for <unk>
I'm a feminist, but pretty bad.
And therefore I was <unk> as a bad feminist label.
Or at least, I wrote a paper, and a book called <unk> <unk> and then in interviews -- people started calling me <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke meant myself and a <unk> <unk> has become a little bigger.
Let me take a step back.
When I was a young man, especially in my youth and at the age of 20 years, I had strange ideas about the <unk> these women <unk> <unk> with men and <unk> as if that was a bad thing.
Today, I see how women are treated around the world and anger, in particular, it looks like a perfectly reasonable response.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that I was using people to <unk> that could be a feminist label.
Being labeled a feminist was a <unk> a taboo and disgusting.
I was <unk> as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, which he asks too much, with high self-esteem and <unk> to believe it's equal or superior to a man.
Nobody wants to be that woman <unk> until it realizes that it's actually that woman and can't imagine being another person.
Over time, as I grew up, I started to accept that I am, in fact, feminist, and also proud to be.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
They had the same wages for the same work.
We have a right to travel around the world like <unk> free or violence.
We have a right to use it very easy and accessible the contraceptives and the services in it.
We have the right to decide about our bodies, without <unk> or doctrines to <unk>
We have a respect.
There's more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you have to have in account our other <unk>
We're not just women.
We are people with a different body, expression of gender, religion and our social condition, skills and much more.
We have to have this differences and how we behave in the same way that what we have in common.
Without this kind of <unk> our feminism is not nothing.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear: I'm a mess.
I'm filled with contradictions.
There's a lot of things that make me a bad feminist label.
I have another confession.
When I work to work, I hear rap music <unk>
Although the letter degrades the women and I was deeply, the classic <unk> classic <unk> the Yin yang <unk> is incredible.
Do you really have your shirt <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> until you get <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry, right?
I'm completely <unk> by my musical taste.
I firmly believe in the work of the man, which is all I don't want to do, <unk> --  -- all the <unk> <unk> but also killing insects, the collection of trash, and the maintenance of <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The pink is my favorite color.
<unk> from fashion magazines and the nice things.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have erotic fantasies of the fairy tales that they make reality.
Some of my crimes are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the name of his husband, it's her choice, and I'm not who for <unk>
If a woman decides to stay home to raise their kids, I agreed to that election, too.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable through this same choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> so that makes women economically vulnerable when they <unk>
So let's take this problem.
<unk> the conventional wisdom that has ignored or <unk> historically the needs of women in color, the gay workers and <unk> for white women and high class.
Listen, if that's good feminism is a very bad feminist issue.
Also the following: I have a lot of pressure.
We have this tendency to put feminists into a <unk>
We hope that we're going to get it right.
And when we were excited about them with a lot of taste from the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I already think of that <unk> before I try to put myself there.
<unk> women, particularly the innovative and the leaders of the sector, are afraid of being tagged as <unk>
They are afraid of standing up and say, "Yes, I am <unk> for fear which means that label for fear not to be able to be able to fulfill the <unk>
Take <unk> or like I call it, <unk>
In the last few years it's a feminist <unk>
In <unk> Music <unk> 2014, in <unk> <unk> in front of the word <unk>
It was a show of <unk> to see this star of poop embracing feminism feminism -- and making women and young men who will be feminist is something to be proud to be proud of.
<unk> the time, cultural critics started endless arguments if we were not just a feminist <unk>
And you know, his feminism, instead of just believing the word of an adult woman and <unk>
<unk> perfection <unk> because we're still fighting for a lot, we want a lot, we need so much, we need a lot.
We're going to go far beyond the sensible criticism and <unk> to <unk> the feminism feminism feminism by any woman, <unk> until it's nothing left.
We don't need to do that.
The bad point is, or rather, a more inclusive feminism is the point of <unk>
But what happens next?
We went to recognize our <unk> to the day, go to action and be a little more <unk>
If I hear music -- I'm creating a demand for artists that would be more happy to provide a supply supply.
These artists will not change their way of talking about women in their songs until it <unk> affecting affecting affecting their profit.
It's certainly hard.
Why does their music be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify a worse choice.
But when the bad decisions would justify that it makes it harder for women to achieve equality, equality that we all deserve and it's our responsibility.
I think of my <unk> three and four years.
These are two girls and <unk> and brilliant, and also very brave. I want to grow in a world.
It's where they were told by strong creatures that they are.
I think of them, all of a sudden, the best choice would be <unk> as much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program is all about sexual violence against women and sports, and <unk> <unk>
We can change the radio station when we hear songs that treat women like nothing.
We can spend our money to go to the cinema in another part when movies are not treating women more than like <unk> objects.
We can stop supporting professional sports where athletes treat their classmates like <unk>
In any case, men, especially young men can say, "No, I'm not going to post in his magazine, to participate in your project, or to work with you, until it doesn't include a number enough of women, both to participate as to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or your organization is more <unk> with a wider range of people."
Those of us who are <unk> but <unk> to participate in these kinds of projects, we can also encourage themselves to be including more as more as we are willing to overcome the barriers to the decision situations.
Because we are not <unk> with these efforts, without taking these <unk> our achievements are going to be very little.
We can make these small actions of courage and hope that our decisions will come to the top, to the people in the power directors, and film producers and music, <unk> the <unk> the people who can make great decisions, more courageous, to create a durable change and meaningful change.
We can also be able to tell our awe -- well, wrong, or any <unk>
The last line of my book, <unk> <unk> says, <unk> will be a bad feminist not to be in <unk>
This is true because of a lot of reasons, but I tell you, about everything, because I think, my voice was <unk> and feminism was helped by <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it incident to address what happened.
A few kids told me when I was very young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
I was treated as if it was nothing.
I started to believe that it was nothing.
<unk> my voice, and after I did not let me believe I could say something that might matter.
But I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I was getting into a stronger version of myself.
I read the words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and the women who looked like me and understood what meant to live in this world if you have your brown skin.
I read the words of the women who showed me that it was nothing.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through the writing and of course I also found that if I was a bit brave another woman could hear me and see me and realize that none of us is nothing that the world is about to tell us that we are.
In one hand, I have the power to achieve anything.
And in the other, I hold the interesting reality that I'm just a woman.
I'm a <unk> I'm a good feminist, I'm trying to improve my way to think, what I say and what I do, without leaving everything that makes me human.
I hope that we can all do the same thing.
I hope that we can all be a little courageous, when you need to be a bit of a <unk>
Right after Christmas of last year, I was going to have been <unk> by having visited <unk> or to be exposed to someone who had been there.
The virus then went through the border with Canada, <unk> over 100 children in <unk>
One of the <unk> things of this outbreak is that the <unk> that may be lousy for a child with an immune immune system, is one of the most easily <unk> diseases in the world.
There is an effective vaccine against this for over half a century ago, but many of the children involved in the <unk> outbreak were not vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something that was supposedly <unk> autism.
But a moment, it was not the article that unleashed the argument about autism and vaccines <unk> disqualified and marked by being an <unk> fraud by British Medical <unk>
It doesn't believe most scientists who have the theory that vaccines cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know, but millions of parents all over the world are still <unk> that vaccines put in danger to their children of having autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the collapse of autism in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very bizarre disease.
The few psychologists and pediatricians who had heard about it creates all his professional life without seeing one case.
For decades, the prevalence was held stable as only three or four children per 100,000.
But then, in the '90s, the numbers began to <unk>
<unk> fundraising <unk> which are routinely referred to autism as an HIV epidemic, as if I could remember another child in <unk>
What's going on?
If it's not vaccines, what is it?
If you ask people from the Center for Disease Control what is going on, they tend to be based on phrases like <unk> diagnostic <unk> and "a better detection of <unk> to explain these <unk> figures.
But that kind of language don't <unk> a lot of fears of a young mother who searches on the face of her son of two years, eye contact.
If the diagnostic criteria had to figure out why they were so <unk> at the beginning?
Why were the case of autism as difficult to find before the decade of <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened has less to be able to do with slow progress and <unk> of the science that with the wisdom of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, the doctors told me a story about what autism is and how it discovered, but that story turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same are having a devastating impact on public health health health.
There was a second most accurate story of autism that had lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us all about how we get here and where we need to go.
The first story begins with a psychiatrist child psychiatrist Leo <unk> at Johns Hopkins Hospital, in <unk> <unk> published an article that describes 11 young patients who looked like <unk> worlds and <unk> people around it, even their own parents.
They could have fun during hours shaking hands on their faces, but they were prey of panic for <unk> as when you don't put their favorite toy in their usual place, without knowing them.
On the base of the patients being treated in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very weird.
By the 1950s, as the main authority of the world in the subject, declared less than 150 true cases of their syndrome while <unk> references from places as far as South Africa.
This is actually not surprisingly, because the criteria of autism for autism diagnosis were very <unk>
For example, <unk> will give that diagnosis to <unk> but now we know that epilepsy is very common in autism.
Once he was <unk> that he had become nine out of every 10 children sent by other doctors to their doctor's office without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart man, but part of his theories weren't <unk>
<unk> autism as a form of childhood <unk> caused by cold parents and <unk>
These kids, he said, well they've stayed carefully on a refrigerator that doesn't <unk>
At the same time, however, <unk> I noticed that some of their young patients had special skills that cluster in certain areas like music, math and memory.
One of the kids in their clinic could distinguish between 18 <unk> before he turned two years old.
When his mother put one of his favorite record, he correctly said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills, claiming things like the kids were simply <unk> what they had heard of their parents who are desperate to win their passing.
As a result, autism became a source of shame for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own well, becoming invisible to the world in general.
Amazingly, it wasn't until the 1970s that researchers started to test the theory of <unk> that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> cognitive psychologist, in London, thinking that the theory of mothers -- <unk> <unk> was pretty stupid.
She and her husband John were warm and <unk> and they had a deep autistic daughter called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a girl as no support and without special education, without special education, and no access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To defend ourselves to the National <unk> Service, they needed more resources for autistic children and their families, Judith Gould decided to do something that should be done about 30 years before.
They did an prevalence of prevalence in the general population.
I wrote a suburb in London called <unk> to try to find the autistic children in the community.
What you saw it was clear that the <unk> model was too limited, because the autism reality was much more <unk> and diverse.
Some kids couldn't speak at all, whereas others were <unk> in their fascination with astrophysics, or in the <unk> of <unk>
Otherwise these kids didn't fit in beautiful <unk> and <unk> as they said, and they saw a lot of them, much more than the <unk> model of <unk> would have predicted.
At first, they were lost to try and make sense of their data.
How did no one realize these children before?
But then <unk> I found a reference to an article that was published in German <unk> the next year to the article of <unk> and then he was <unk> buried under the ashes of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
<unk> knew about this article of competition, but I avoided <unk> in his own work.
There was not even a translation in English, but luckily, the husband of <unk> he talked German, and he took him for her.
The document offers an alternative story of autism.
His author was a man named Hans <unk> who ran an integrated clinic with a school in Vienna, in the 1930s.
The ideas of Asperger's for teaching children with learning differences were <unk> even for contemporary standards.
The morning in your clinic started with classes exercises with music, and the kids followed their games on Sunday afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parents of causing autism, Asperger's as a disabled disability, for life that required <unk> and <unk> spaces over the course of life.
Instead of treating children in their clinic as patients, Asperger's -- he called them their little teachers, and he started to help in the development methods that were especially suited for them.
<unk> Asperger's as autism as a diverse continuum that included an amazing variety of gifts, and disability.
He believed that autism and autistic traits were common and always have been, watching this continuum in <unk> <unk> as the <unk> social scientist, and Professor <unk>
He was beyond even to say that for success in science and art, a little bit of autism is essential.
<unk> and Judith found that he was wrong when autism was <unk> as well as the parents were <unk>
In the next few years, they worked in silence with the American Association of <unk> to expand the criteria of the diagnosis that reflect the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
By the end of the '80s and early '90s, their changes enter into the <unk> of the limited model of <unk> by a broader and inclusive.
These changes didn't go in a broken bag.
<unk> when <unk> and Judith worked <unk> to reform these <unk> people around the world see an autistic adult every time.
Before he went out of <unk> <unk> in 1988, just a little circle, <unk> by experts knew what autism, but after the <unk> act of <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the same time, they introduced the first easy clinics to use to diagnose autism.
There was no longer to have a connection with that little circle of experts to get a diagnosis for his son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> the changes in the criteria and the introduction of these tests created a network, a perfect storm of autism consciousness.
The number of diagnoses began to <unk> the same as predicted as predicted as they predicted <unk> and <unk> in fact they expected that so that it was, making people with autism and their families finally supported the support and the services that were <unk>
So Andrew <unk> got to blame vaccines for increasing <unk> and a simple, powerful, <unk> story as bad as the theory of <unk> that autism was <unk>
If the present estimate of the prevention center that one of every 68 children in America are in the spectrum, it's right, the <unk> are one of the world's largest <unk> groups.
In the last few years, autistic people have joined the Internet to reject the idea that they're puzzles for solving by the new medical breakthroughs and <unk> the term <unk> to celebrate the varieties of human cognition.
One way to understand <unk> is to think about human operating systems.
The fact that a PC does not work with Windows doesn't mean it's cut.
According to the <unk> standards, the normal human brain is easily <unk> social <unk> and it suffers from a deficit deficit to detail.
Certainly autistic people have difficulty living in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still reaching <unk> that believed that the <unk> for the most common aspects of autism are found in the understanding of the teachers, employers employers who are capacity, communities of support, and parents with faith in the potential of their children.
An autistic woman named <unk> <unk> once said, "We need all the hands on cover to <unk> the ship of the <unk>
As we walked into an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to address the challenges that we face as a society.
We cannot afford to waste a brain.
Thank you.
